Architecturally, we are unable to use either\nthe MySQL or Apache Derby databases and any database that we do use cannot be\ninstalled locally on a user machine.  Our development teams have looked at the\npossibility of modifying the code to support a SQL Server or Oracle DBMS and\nutilise a central database however their estimates of the effort involve\nindicate a significant cost to this.  I was wondering if any other companies\nmay have undertaken this work already and submitted it back to yourselves for\ndistribution or whether this is something the compendium team are working on\nfor a future release.\n\nMany thanks,\nTrevor Davies\nTechnical Architect\nBritish Energy\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 1 Michelle Bachler 2007-06-13 12:50:11 BST\n\nNo, unfortunately not and we have no plans at present to extend the system to\nsupport further databases. You can submit a feature request for this, and it\nwill be considered along with all others, but it is unlikely to become a\npriority for us at present. This is the sort of area that we hoped external\ndevelopers would contribute in though.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 2 Dirk Gorissen 2010-02-16 08:46:38 GMT\n\nIts been more than two years since this post but it is an issue I am also\ninterested in.  From the mailinglist I understood that still no work has been\ndone in this direction.\n\nI loaded the code into eclipse and it all looks quite clean and well\nstructured.  The SQL looks fairly standard as well so Im almost tempted to give\nit a shot.  The only problem is the distinction between Derby and MySQL is made\nusing constants and methods with different names, spread across different\nclasses.  Adding versions for SQLServer is probably not the cleanest way to go\nabout this.  \n\nAnyway, if I do produce some working code I will post it here.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 3 Michelle Bachler 2010-02-16 11:56:34 GMT\n\nYes, sorry about that.\nAt some point I wanted to abstract it all more, so it was easier to add new\ndatabase types.

It''s certainly not an absent\nminded momentary triviality to create a consistent style (which deviates\nsignificantly from the default) within a map or between maps (for nodes, links,\nbackgrounds, text, etc.)\n\nI think the qualitative experience of using Compendium could be improved hugely\nmerely by improving the fluency of style management.\n\ni suggest using style palettes. \n\nBy "palette" i mean, for each compendium element that can have style: a list of\nstyles available for selection. \n* Each compendium element will have its own style list.\n* The style list will have a default where a new compendium elements is created\nwith the default style. The default can be changed.\n* The list can added to by selection of a compendium element and copying its\nstyle to the list, the new style being nameable. (eg. select compendium item,\nclick a menu strip button or rt click and "add to style list")\n* The list can have items renamed and deleted.\n\nI suppose the compendium elements are: node, link and map(open).  Maybe each\nnode type could have its own style palette.\n\neg. for a link style, i should be able to set all the qualities for a link\n(including text), and save it to a name in the link style palette.  I should\nalso be able to select one or a number of links and click a "style button" to\napply that style onto the element(s).\n\nsimilarly for nodes and maps.\n\n... just to go further out on the limb ...\nrather than have the style palette defaults be global, it might be useful to\nhave:\neach map have its own set of element style defaults (to make it easier for each\nmap to maintain its style).\n... also, if each map has its own collection of element style defaults, then a\nnew map created within this map could inherit that set of defaults.\n\nto reiterate: I think the qualitative experience of using Compendium could be\nimproved hugely merely by improving the fluency of style management.\n\nComment 1 Al Selvin 2011-02-06 18:05:31 GMT\n\nJust a comment. \n\nYou can do many of these things already in Compendium by setting Project or\nUser Options (Tools menu), as well as by creating custom Link Groups, Stencils,\nand other means.\n\nHaving said that, it could always be easier to do.

Unfortunately, it''s not easy to create space on the Compendium background\nfor new windows.  Windows can''t have their boundaries moved beyond the\nbackground boundary.  That means there''s a lot of window management activity in\nresponse to something conceptually simple.\n\nAlso, because mysql projects can be accessed across different pcs (with\ndifferent screen dimensions) then this means a map that opened ok on one\nscreen, may be too large for another screen - despite not being designed for\nthis eventuality.  This means some fiddly window management required to "pull\nin" the map boundary from beyond the edge of the background boundary.\n\nfeature request:\n================\nA solution to this could be to allow window to be designed to be moved such\nthat their boundaries go beyond the background boundary.

I also use the Workspaces system to layout and remember\narrangements of maps I use a lot.The Window Menu also has the usual Cascade and\ntile options (which would recover Windows if they left the visible area). \n\nIn older versions of Compendium windows they could leave the visible area. But\nthen we had complaints about lost windows going off the edge and then I think I\nadded the constraint that the Windows had to stay. I started writting a scroll\nmechanism so Windows could go off, but you could scroll to them. I had issues\ngetting this working and it was buggy. So for a quick fix I just stopped\nWindows leaving the area. It is something I need to go back to.\n\nMichelle',0,'compendiumng')

In order to participate in the\ntimeline view, the node would probably need to be manually dated, as the\nmodification date of the node is probably not meaningful in this context.\n\nHere''s an example of how I envision this working. Suppose I''m investigating the\nhistorical development of an idea (for example, the concept of a "canon of\nscripture" in Judaism and Christianity). In the course of my research, I\naccumulate various quotations from relevant ancient and modern writers and I\nstuff them into Reference nodes, which I tag with dates indicating my best\nguess of what year each quotation was written. These quotations are probably\nsupporting facts in the argument structure of one or more of my map views, but\nI also want to see how they relate to one another chronologically, so I\ncopy/paste them into a timeline view. Then, to provide additional context, I\ncreate additional nodes directly in the timeline view representing the dates of\nvarious events (e.g., the Council of Trent) and the lifespans of the relevant\nfigures (e.g., the life of Eusebius). In this way, I construct a visual\nchronology of the topic I''m investigating, with each node in the timeline being\nhyperlinked to references, related events and/or argumentation related to that\nevent.\n\nOne issue to keep in mind is that dates of ancient events are generally\nimprecise, and sometimes disputed. Thus, the date that a particular event\nhappened (e.g., the composition of the document known as "the Gospel according\nto Mark") could be the subject of one of the Questions under argumentation,\nwith different authors proposing different dates and arguing for their\nproposals, and the user might make a Decision regarding this issue. In my\nopinion, the timeline view should be able to indicate (a) spans of time (e.g.,\nby drawing the event as a rectangle rather than as a single point in time) as\nwell as (b) uncertainty/debate regarding a date/span (e.g., by drawing the\nuncertain time span as a fade-out from fully opaque to fully transparent.\n\nThe timeline view might be even more useful if, instead of having to manually\ncopy/paste nodes into the timeline view, I can instead link the timeline view\nto one or more map/list views, so that anything in one of those views with an\nassociated date is automatically plotted on the timeline. This would make it\nharder for things to get out-of-sync between my various views, since I only\nneed to worry about dating the various nodes, and not also copy/pasting them.\nOne additional enhancement could make it _impossible_ for things to get\nout-of-sync: if I could set a constraint on my map/list view that says\n"everything in here is required to have a date", then Compendium could help me\nby complaining "hey, you need to give this node a date!". Or, alternately,\nnodes in the linked views that don''t have dates could be drawn in a "date\nunknown" region of the timeline, which would be a way of visually notifying me\nthat I''d forgotten to date something.',0,'compendiumng')

And then, the symbols surrounding the icons are arcane to the\nnew user, or worse, to the non-user.\n\nAnd this leads to an additional shortcoming - I want to use the mind-map to\n_communicate_ to another person.  I want them to be able to "see" my ideas, not\nsome arcane "structure" and classification system.

The "tree" should be modeled as "flat" and\nvisible, rather than "deep" and invisible.

Somewhere in the menus (probably "Tools")\nthere''s an item that opens up a "search manager" or some such, in which I can\nspecify URLs and query string formats for interacting with various sites on the\nInternet. You might consider using one or more of the existing web standards\nfor defining search engine interactions, such as OpenSearch and/or Sherlock,\nand let me download pre-defined search plugins from the web.\nhttp://mycroft.mozdev.org/ claims to have over 23,000 search plugins for\nvarious browsers...it would be nice if Compendium could download and use these\nrather than requiring me to describe the search protocol myself. (Bonus points\nif Compendium automatically checks for updates to the plugins every so often!)\n\nAnyway, however the search plugins get created, once I have them registered\nwith Compendium, I''d like to be able to create Reference nodes that use them\ninstead of requiring me to input a URL. I think this could be done in the UI by\nmigrating the current Reference-specific fields into their own "Reference" tab\nalongside "Contents", "Properties" and "Views". In this tab, the first UI\nelement would be a drop-down box that lets me choose "URL" (in order to get the\ncurrent Reference behavior) or any of my currently registered search plugins.\nThe rest of the UI in this tab would change based on the variable fields\nspecific to my selected search plugin. So, for example, if Bugzilla search lets\nme specify (a) keywords (b) bug status (c) bug ID and (d) opened-by, all of\nthese would be text fields or drop-downs (as appropriate), created based on the\ndefinition of the search plugin. (Bonus points if the search plugin''s icon is\ndisplayed as the Reference node icon.)\n\nAlso, I think that if you reworked the Reference UI in this way, you could also\nextend this to handle internal reference nodes more elegantly: if I select\n"Internal" from the reference type drop-down, the UI could change to some kind\nof graphical selector that allows me to choose a node from one of my maps,\nright from the dialog box. This would be instead of that very cryptic comp://\nURL that you currently allow me to edit (but warn me not to touch in the help\nfiles).\n\nProbably also related to 974.\n\nAlso, it would be super-cool if there were some really efficient way to create\nReference nodes using certain search engines. For example, if I have a search\nplugin that targets http://www.biblegateway.com, I''d like to be able to use a\nhot-key to insert a Reference using this plugin, and then just type the search\ntext as the node label (e.g., "John 3:16"), and have the primary search field\nauto-populated with this value, without me ever having to open up the contents\ndialog box.',0,'compendiumng')

In that spirit, I think I will lay out the\nfull cluster of features I would like to have ideally.\n\nI have been corresponding with a number of people, here and elsewhere,\nabout our mutual desire to be able to build a dialogue map collectively (but\nperhaps asynchronously) in a manner analogous to the construction of the\nWikipedia. I know that there are people here working on, or at least thinking\nof working on, this goal. \n\nTo a version of Compendium that supports dialogue maps created in this fashion,\nI would like to add an "AutoWiki" feature. It would look something like this:\n\nWe start with a map that is editable by any group member (with good \n"restore" and history functions!!). When the AutoWiki feature is\nturned on, we require that as the map is constructed, each node and\nline be named meaningfully, using the common wiki "CamelCase" naming\nconvention. You would need a special procedure to add such names if\nyou turn it on for an existing map without them. The meaningful names\nwould be used in addition to or in place of the existing automatically\ngenerated tags for linking purposes.\n\nAutoWiki will then automatically create a reciprocally connected wiki\npage of the same name, with the usual assortment of wiki features and tools for\nboth common text and dialogue about that text. \n\nWithin the wiki, use of a PageName creates a link to the named page\nin the usual way. But for page created with AutoWiki, the PageName link at the\ntop of the page takes you to the same-named link or node in the dialogue map.\n\nEach page would also have an assortment of finders'' tools accessible\nfrom it. These could include automatically generated pairs of links,\none to each node to which it is connected and one to the corresponding\npage; a pop-up index of all the pages on which that page/node name\noccurs; and a link to an automatically generated alphabetical list of\nall the pages and nodes in the system.\n\nI am not sure if documentation and evidence should be attached to the the map\nor the wiki page. I''m also not sure what you do with a page, or documentation\nattached to a page, if the node is deleted. Maybe a bin for deleted structures?\n\nAs someone who is not a professional programmer, I may be kidding myself about\nhow hard it would be to create such a system, but I do want to observe that\nwikis are generally open-source and that all wikis have easy standard features\nfor creating a page with a specified name and for automatically creating live\nlinks to that page wherever in the wiki the name is used. Most also have\nstructured discussion features such as those mentioned above as options. As a\nresult, i think it would be possible to add a lot of functionality to\nCompendium for a modest investment of effort. And of course you would not need\nevery thing i mentioned on the first pass. For example, some of the finders''\ntools could be\nadded later.\n\nOf all of the features embodied in this request, the ones that I think are most\ncritical to allowing the uses of Compendium to foster dialogs with distributed\nparticipants is the ability to give each node and link a unique, meaningful tag\n(â€œhandleâ€), ideally user-chosen, a convenient way to insert a link to\nanother website, and an easy way for distributed participants to learn the\nhandles and the associated url''s (perhaps by having a window from which it can\nbe copied pop up on hover) so that they can link to or from the node or line\nwith the specified handle. With these facilities and no more, a moderator could\nelaborate the dialogue map as it emerges from the discussion on a related site,\nand manual but easy and intuitive tools for linking back and fort from the map\nto discussions that take place on a related site (in any of a wide range of\nformats) could be constructed. \n\nIt would be even nicer if these tools could be automated, of course. And it\nwould be nice if several alternative visual and informational structures for\nthe related dialogue could be used â€“ threaded discussion, wiki, â€œyahoo\ngroupâ€-style forum, etc. â€“ though I think it is far more important to get\none up and working well than to get several that sort-of work most of the time. \n\nReturning to for a moment to the question of allowing distributed users to\nbuild a map, I have nothing to contribute on the technical side of this\ndiscussion, but I want to add a word or two from the perspective of a\nprospective user.\n\nThere are many, many cases where you want to bring a group of people together\nto engage in a discussion of make a decision where the commitment of the people\ninvolved is limited and the organizers do not have direct authority over the\nparticipants nor the resources to compensate (or threaten) them. This is the\n_typical_ situation in collaborative processes in the NGO setting, were I work,\nand a common one in academia, user groups, and many other settings. \n\nIn this setting it is essential that the cost of entry be low and the rewards\nimmediate. Organizers of this sort of process may have significant investment\nin making them go well, and can be asked to spend some time climbing the\nlearning curve. Also, once a participant has bought into a process and become\ninvested in its methods and outcome the participants are often willing to\ndevote genuine resources to making it work. But before such buy-in takes place,\neven quite minor barriers will cause potentially valuable participants to put\ntheir energy elsewhere.\n\nSomething I would put in the category, not of a minor barrier, but of a\nsignificant one, would be the requirement that participants install a piece of\nsoftware and learn how to use it. For most of the on-line dialogues I deal with\non a daily basis, this would be enough to guarantee that the process collapses\nbefore it gets properly started. I would therefore strongly urge that if there\nis any way to make the system work with a web-based interface, or some other\nsystem that uses software with which people believe themselves to be familiar,\neven at the cost of some functionality.\n\nIt is worth observing that people generally feel like they know what a browser\nis and what it does, even though they lack any technical understanding of the\nprocess. Moreover, I have observed that this familiarity can result in people\nfeeling like they are using software that they know how to use, even where the\nprocedure that they must use on a remote page is quite different from what they\nmost often do.

The most obvious of these is the top/left/right\nnavigation bars -- on a site with many pages, you wouldn''t want to\nhave to maintain these on every individual page if they basically are\nthe same across many pages.\n\nAlong with our (blessed) ability to have map backgrounds that can be\nany sort of graphic/layout, I think we need some kind of "include"\nability, similar to HTML includes, that can place not just single\nobjects (e.g. a graphic) but something like portions of other maps\nonto our maps.\n\nFor example, you could have a map that has a set of map nodes that\njust takes up the very top of a map (like the top navigation bar on a\nwebsite). I''d like the capability to "include"/transclude that map on\nthe top of another map.\n\nThat way you could just maintain the top navigation in one place in\nyour project, but have it update on all the other maps it''s\nincluded/transcluded in.\n\nObviously this is a big change to how we handle things today, but it\nwould be extremely useful not only for web publishing but also\nprojects like Co-OPR that have repeating navigation on many maps.\n\nFrom Maarten:\nMy only thought at the moment is to use something like templates in MediaWiki:\n\n"In MediaWiki, a template is a page which can be inserted into another page via\na process called transclusion. It is a wiki subroutine or iframe facility and\nis comparable to a #include statement or macro that is expanded at page view\ntime. Substitution allows templates to be used as a macro facility."\n\nMy response:\nI wonder if there is some way to do that within Compendium itself. Failing\nthat, we could at least (and more easily) do something on the HTML export\nlevel. We do have an enhancement on the list (for a long time) to allow custom\nHTML header and footer files to be added for web exports, this could be part of\nthat.

Somewhere in the menus (probably "Tools")\nthere''s an item that opens up a "search manager" or some such, in which I can\nspecify URLs and query string formats for interacting with various sites on the\nInternet. You might consider using one or more of the existing web standards\nfor defining search engine interactions, such as OpenSearch and/or Sherlock,\nand let me download pre-defined search plugins from the web.\nhttp://mycroft.mozdev.org/ claims to have over 23,000 search plugins for\nvarious browsers...it would be nice if Compendium could download and use these\nrather than requiring me to describe the search protocol myself. (Bonus points\nif Compendium automatically checks for updates to the plugins every so often!)\n\nAnyway, however the search plugins get created, once I have them registered\nwith Compendium, I''d like to be able to create Reference nodes that use them\ninstead of requiring me to input a URL. I think this could be done in the UI by\nmigrating the current Reference-specific fields into their own "Reference" tab\nalongside "Contents", "Properties" and "Views". In this tab, the first UI\nelement would be a drop-down box that lets me choose "URL" (in order to get the\ncurrent Reference behavior) or any of my currently registered search plugins.\nThe rest of the UI in this tab would change based on the variable fields\nspecific to my selected search plugin. So, for example, if Bugzilla search lets\nme specify (a) keywords (b) bug status (c) bug ID and (d) opened-by, all of\nthese would be text fields or drop-downs (as appropriate), created based on the\ndefinition of the search plugin. (Bonus points if the search plugin''s icon is\ndisplayed as the Reference node icon.)\n\nAlso, I think that if you reworked the Reference UI in this way, you could also\nextend this to handle internal reference nodes more elegantly: if I select\n"Internal" from the reference type drop-down, the UI could change to some kind\nof graphical selector that allows me to choose a node from one of my maps,\nright from the dialog box. This would be instead of that very cryptic comp://\nURL that you currently allow me to edit (but warn me not to touch in the help\nfiles).\n\nProbably also related to 974.\n\nComment 3 Ryan Saunders 2011-06-19 07:49:48 BST\n\nAlso, it would be super-cool if there were some really efficient way to create\nReference nodes using certain search engines. For example, if I have a search\nplugin that targets http://www.biblegateway.com, I''d like to be able to use a\nhot-key to insert a Reference using this plugin, and then just type the search\ntext as the node label (e.g., "John 3:16"), and have this the main search field\nauto-populated with this value, without me ever having to open up the contents\ndialog box.\n\nComment 4 Michelle Bachler 2011-06-20 12:19:15 BST\n\nI think this is a completely new feature request you have descibed here.

I change it back to straigt and change\nthichnes to 3 pt.\nResult: Link is straigt but 1 pt.\nIn the tool as well. I change thickness again to 3 pt and save again (Link and\nGroup of course).\nAnd: Link is still 3 pt (even when I draw a new one with this definition).\nLooking back in the Link-Group Tool: I see: 1 pt.\nErgo: Save doesnt work as expectet.\n\nComment 5 Michelle Bachler 2011-09-16 09:20:15 BST\n\nNow you say that I think there was a bug in Beta 1 with saving links which I\nhad forgotten until you mentioned it. I think have fixed it now for Beta 2. \n\nWORKAROUND: You can change the settings directly in the saved xml file if you\nare feeling adventurous. As you are unlikely to keep chaning it, it should not\nbe too onerous.\n\ngo to: <compendium dir>/Systems/resources/LinkGroups\nopen the xml file for your new linkgroup in a text editor.\n\nEach link is represented by a line in the file, which can be broken down as\nfollows:\n\n<linktype \nid="46" \nname="About" \ncolour="-16711681" \nlabel="" \narrowtype="1" \nlinkstyle="1" \nlinkdashed="0" \nlinkweight="1" \n/>\n\nid: leave the id number alone.\n\nname: the name as it appears in the link type lists.\n\ncolour: this would not be easy to add as these are generaled from java colours,\nso you could copy ones around from the default for now.\n\nlabel: any default text yopu want to automatically appear in the link when it\nis created.\n\narrowtypes options: \nNO_ARROW        = 0;\nARROW_TO        = 1;\nARROW_FROM        = 2;\nARROW_TO_AND_FROM    = 3;\n\nlinkstyle options:\n\nSTRAIGHT_LINK        = 0;\nCURVED_LINK        = 1;\nSQUARE_LINK        = 2;\n\nlinkdashed options:\n\nPLAIN_LINE        = 0;\nLARGE_DASHED_LINE    = 1;\nSMALL_DASHED_LINE    = 2;\n\nlinkweight: just a number count 1,2,3,4 etc representing thickness.\n\nHopefully this workaround will help until the beta 2 comes out.\n\nMichelle\n\n',0,'compendiumng')

It is not bad when you''re doing single tags here\nand there, but not so good when doing multiple tags in different combinations\nin rapid succession.\n\nCouple of things I thought of (besides the kb shortcuts in the works):\n\n- have a copy/paste special or similar action that would copy just the tags\nfrom one node and paste special them onto others (similar to Excel paste\nspecial formats or values)\n\n- have a "Tag Again" command (or Redo or similar action) that would apply the\nsame tag set as last done\n\nAlso I noticed that Alt-X didn''t work when more than one node was selected.\n\nAnother kind of problematic thing about the current UI is that (as Maarten has\npointed out) it takes too many clicks to assign multiple tags. A lot of times I\nleft out one of the many steps and ended up closing the dialog without having\nactually assigned any tags. Even with the kb shortcuts coming, we still need a\nbetter UI for ''power-tagging''... I don''t have any clear ideas although the\nabove may help. I''ll try to enlist my volunteer UI design corps to think about\nit.\n\nAl\n12/2005\n\nMay now be addressed by new Tags interface w/1.5.1 (AMS)\n(from old db, medium list)',0,'compendiumng')

Otherwise it would behave and\nhave the same properties as any other node type (Details, etc.)\n- Linking would work just like our other node types, except around the\nrectangle,.\n- Users could set the size of the rectangle, or it would grow as the size of\nthe label text\n\nThe below should be in Courier to see it correctly:\n\n------------------------------------\n| So the label of a Concept node |\n| would look something like this. |\n| It would wrap within the |\n| boundaries of the rectangle. |\n------------------------------------\n\nAl\n5/2004\n(from old db, medium list)\n\nComment 1 Michelle Bachler 2009-06-20 12:11:49 BST\n\nsee 226, 241\n\n',0,'compendiumng')

In this case, if it were switched on (via a checkbox in the Node\nProperties dialog), a rollover would perform an action like show a full-size\ngraphic, play a sound, even play a movie clip. It could even run a script that\nthe Ref node links to (e.g. a Javascript file).\n\nIn the short run, I''m most interested in the graphic and possibly sound\nrollover (so the scenario would be, rather than having to double-click on the\nRef node to launch a separate application to see the full-size graphic, it\nwould just display as an image within Compendium on rollover).\n\nThis would be terrific for educational uses of Compendium -- i.e. using\nCompendium to present a lecture, and as an off-line reference tool.\n\nIt would also pass this behavior on to exports (so for example an HTML page\nexported from Compendium would have the same rollover behavior on an image\nexported from a Reference node).\n\nThoughts?\n\nAl\n\n\nJust thinking about this some more... It would seem to make sense to me to \nhave the icon itself be the rollover point, since it is the image (or file. \netc.) that one would be interested in seeing fullsize. Remember that the \nrollover would have to be intentionally ''turned on'', it wouldn''t/shouldn''t \nbe the default behavior.\n\nAl\n\n\nIt''s a silly example, but what I have in mind should look/feel like the turtle\nimage on the right side of the page (down a bit) on\nhttp://www.wilsoninfo.com/rollgen1.html\n\n\n\n\n\n"M.S.Bachler" on 09/02/2003 11:54:20 AM\n\nTo: Al \ncc:\n\nSubject: RE: Double-click and triple-click in label\n\n\nAs a layer over the top of other nodes-links on the screen, like our other hint\nboxes for views and details?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSure, that makes sense.

The behavior I have in mind is just like a web page rollover --\nsomething appears as part of the existing view on rollover, not a separate\nwindow, etc.\n\nAl\n\n\nHi,\n\nIt''s not the effort that''s the issue so much as the flow in a presentation or\nnarrative mode. Double-clicking to launch a separate application (then having\nto close it again) can be disruptive, just as it would be if you had to do it\non a web page to see a rollover image. There are times when\ndouble-clicking/launching is desirable (the present state), but other times\nwhen a smooth flow is desirable and double-clicking/launching would disrupt\nthat flow.\n\nSo my idea is that double-clicking/launching is the default as at present, but\nrollover behavior is an option. I do like the idea of having a particular icon\nor area of the node to roll over to invoke the rollover behavior (to avoid the\nproblem of "unintentional rollover" that you point out). A little "R" perhaps.\nBut again, the idea is smooth flow, as opposed to having to click and launch.\n\nOne question is whether this is possible within Java as it is within web pages.\n\nAl\n\n\nHi there\n\nHmmm... not sure that roll-over is the best user interface device to use for\nthis: I would trigger events when I just want to move a node or edit the label.\nIs double-clicking such an overhead? It''s the normal way to launch events.\n\nI suppose one option is for a little icon to appear above the node (analogous\nto the T or * ) which analogously, when clicked launches the event, but surely\na double-click is not much more effort?\n\nsimon\n\n\n5/2003\n(from old db, medium list)',0,'compendiumng')

Bruce Kimball 2009-06-18 17:53:48 BST\n\nI have this need as well, and have been very successful as follows... Extract\nall text-only content of the attached documents and place it into page 2 and\nbeyond of the notes for the reference node. With a PDF, for example, you can\nusually select-all (if it is not just an image), copy and paste. A spreadsheet\ncan be exported as a csv. Similar tricks work with HTML and other document\ntypes. I prefer to do this on page 2 and beyond so that my "key word index"\ndoes not come up in the mouseovers, reserving page one of the notes for "real"\nnotes which I do wish to see on the mouseovers. I learned that search was not\nworking on page 2+ of the notes, but this has now been fixed (see bug #781).\nI''m not sure when we will have it in a downloadable release, but I am looking\nforward to this fix! My workaround in the meanwhile is to leave "real notes" at\nthe top of page one, and push all of the text for searching down on a sometimes\nvery long page one. You can also build a "key word or search-terms index" for\neach doc in the notes of course, which would also work if you need only a few\ncritical terms. I find it pretty effortless and useful just to throw in the\nentire content. Perhaps you would like to sneak this tip into the documentation\non searching, since I suspect this will be a common feature request (searching\non reference documents).\n\n',0,'compendiumng')

Architecturally, we are unable to use either\nthe MySQL or Apache Derby databases and any database that we do use cannot be\ninstalled locally on a user machine.  Our development teams have looked at the\npossibility of modifying the code to support a SQL Server or Oracle DBMS and\nutilise a central database however their estimates of the effort involve\nindicate a significant cost to this.  I was wondering if any other companies\nmay have undertaken this work already and submitted it back to yourselves for\ndistribution or whether this is something the compendium team are working on\nfor a future release.\n\nMany thanks,\nTrevor Davies\nTechnical Architect\nBritish Energy\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 1 Michelle Bachler 2007-06-13 12:50:11 BST\n\nNo, unfortunately not and we have no plans at present to extend the system to\nsupport further databases. You can submit a feature request for this, and it\nwill be considered along with all others, but it is unlikely to become a\npriority for us at present. This is the sort of area that we hoped external\ndevelopers would contribute in though.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 2 Dirk Gorissen 2010-02-16 08:46:38 GMT\n\nIts been more than two years since this post but it is an issue I am also\ninterested in.  From the mailinglist I understood that still no work has been\ndone in this direction.\n\nI loaded the code into eclipse and it all looks quite clean and well\nstructured.  The SQL looks fairly standard as well so Im almost tempted to give\nit a shot.  The only problem is the distinction between Derby and MySQL is made\nusing constants and methods with different names, spread across different\nclasses.

The default can be changed.\n* The list can added to by selection of a compendium element and copying its\nstyle to the list, the new style being nameable. (eg. select compendium item,\nclick a menu strip button or rt click and "add to style list")\n* The list can have items renamed and deleted.\n\nI suppose the compendium elements are: node, link and map(open).  Maybe each\nnode type could have its own style palette.\n\neg. for a link style, i should be able to set all the qualities for a link\n(including text), and save it to a name in the link style palette.

Unfortunately, it''s not easy to create space on the Compendium background\nfor new windows.  Windows can''t have their boundaries moved beyond the\nbackground boundary.  That means there''s a lot of window management activity in\nresponse to something conceptually simple.\n\nAlso, because mysql projects can be accessed across different pcs (with\ndifferent screen dimensions) then this means a map that opened ok on one\nscreen, may be too large for another screen - despite not being designed for\nthis eventuality.  This means some fiddly window management required to "pull\nin" the map boundary from beyond the edge of the background boundary.\n\nfeature request:\n================\nA solution to this could be to allow window to be designed to be moved such\nthat their boundaries go beyond the background boundary.  It would make moving\nwindows out of the way to find a previously covered and relevant map a simple\nact rather than a fiddly one.\n\nBut .. this could create an additional problem .. a map that has been moved\nnear to the edge of the background on one pc screen, could be beyond the edge\nand not at all visible on another pc with a smaller screen ..\n\nfeature request:\n================\n.. so, i suggest a window management menu option to "gather" all open maps to\nthe top left of the background. .. or .. \nfeature request:\n================\ncompendium, when opening a map, auto-detects its position relative to the\nbackground and moves it to top-left if it''s beyond the bounds of the\nbackground.\n\n-- i hope i haven''t explained myself in too confusing a manner.  What i''ve\nwritten seems more complicated than i thought it would be for a straightforward\nidea.\n\nComment 1 mail 2011-02-18 09:23:35 GMT\n\n(In reply to comment #0)\n\n.. it just occurred to me that the simplest solution to this would be to free\nthe map windows from the compendium background entirely (in the same way that\nthe popup windows aren''t limited in their movement by the compendium\nbackground).\n\nbut i guess, that would mean, when the map windows are minimised, they would\nminimise into the Windows Taskbar rather than the Compendium background.\n\nComment 2 Michelle Bachler 2011-02-18 10:23:49 GMT\n\nI have not had a window management issue myself. But maybe I don''t have many\nWindows open at once.\n\nI tend to use the Window Menu where it lists the open Windows to jump between\nthem when I need to. I also use the Workspaces system to layout and remember\narrangements of maps I use a lot.The Window Menu also has the usual Cascade and\ntile options (which would recover Windows if they left the visible area). \n\nIn older versions of Compendium windows they could leave the visible area. But\nthen we had complaints about lost windows going off the edge and then I think I\nadded the constraint that the Windows had to stay. I started writting a scroll\nmechanism so Windows could go off, but you could scroll to them. I had issues\ngetting this working and it was buggy. So for a quick fix I just stopped\nWindows leaving the area. It is something I need to go back to.\n\nMichelle')

In order to participate in the\ntimeline view, the node would probably need to be manually dated, as the\nmodification date of the node is probably not meaningful in this context.\n\nHere''s an example of how I envision this working. Suppose I''m investigating the\nhistorical development of an idea (for example, the concept of a "canon of\nscripture" in Judaism and Christianity). In the course of my research, I\naccumulate various quotations from relevant ancient and modern writers and I\nstuff them into Reference nodes, which I tag with dates indicating my best\nguess of what year each quotation was written. These quotations are probably\nsupporting facts in the argument structure of one or more of my map views, but\nI also want to see how they relate to one another chronologically, so I\ncopy/paste them into a timeline view. Then, to provide additional context, I\ncreate additional nodes directly in the timeline view representing the dates of\nvarious events (e.g., the Council of Trent) and the lifespans of the relevant\nfigures (e.g., the life of Eusebius). In this way, I construct a visual\nchronology of the topic I''m investigating, with each node in the timeline being\nhyperlinked to references, related events and/or argumentation related to that\nevent.\n\nOne issue to keep in mind is that dates of ancient events are generally\nimprecise, and sometimes disputed. Thus, the date that a particular event\nhappened (e.g., the composition of the document known as "the Gospel according\nto Mark") could be the subject of one of the Questions under argumentation,\nwith different authors proposing different dates and arguing for their\nproposals, and the user might make a Decision regarding this issue. In my\nopinion, the timeline view should be able to indicate (a) spans of time (e.g.,\nby drawing the event as a rectangle rather than as a single point in time) as\nwell as (b) uncertainty/debate regarding a date/span (e.g., by drawing the\nuncertain time span as a fade-out from fully opaque to fully transparent.\n\nThe timeline view might be even more useful if, instead of having to manually\ncopy/paste nodes into the timeline view, I can instead link the timeline view\nto one or more map/list views, so that anything in one of those views with an\nassociated date is automatically plotted on the timeline. This would make it\nharder for things to get out-of-sync between my various views, since I only\nneed to worry about dating the various nodes, and not also copy/pasting them.\nOne additional enhancement could make it _impossible_ for things to get\nout-of-sync: if I could set a constraint on my map/list view that says\n"everything in here is required to have a date", then Compendium could help me\nby complaining "hey, you need to give this node a date!". Or, alternately,\nnodes in the linked views that don''t have dates could be drawn in a "date\nunknown" region of the timeline, which would be a way of visually notifying me\nthat I''d forgotten to date something.')

As you are unlikely to keep chaning it, it should not\nbe too onerous.\n\ngo to: <compendium dir>/Systems/resources/LinkGroups\nopen the xml file for your new linkgroup in a text editor.\n\nEach link is represented by a line in the file, which can be broken down as\nfollows:\n\n<linktype \nid="46" \nname="About" \ncolour="-16711681" \nlabel="" \narrowtype="1" \nlinkstyle="1" \nlinkdashed="0" \nlinkweight="1" \n/>\n\nid: leave the id number alone.\n\nname: the name as it appears in the link type lists.\n\ncolour: this would not be easy to add as these are generaled from java colours,\nso you could copy ones around from the default for now.\n\nlabel: any default text you want to automatically appear in the link when it\nis created.\n\narrowtypes options: \nNO_ARROW        = 0;\nARROW_TO        = 1;\nARROW_FROM        = 2;\nARROW_TO_AND_FROM    = 3;\n\nlinkstyle options:\n\nSTRAIGHT_LINK        = 0;\nCURVED_LINK        = 1;\nSQUARE_LINK        = 2;\n\nlinkdashed options:\n\nPLAIN_LINE        = 0;\nLARGE_DASHED_LINE    = 1;\nSMALL_DASHED_LINE    = 2;\n\nlinkweight: just a number count 1,2,3,4 etc representing thickness.\n\nHopefully this workaround will help until the beta 2 comes out.\n\nMichelle\n\nComment 4 Sunnysekot 2011-09-17 10:58:52 BST\n\nCreated an attachment (id=446) [details]\nmy link-group xml-file\n\nComment 5 Sunnysekot 2011-09-17 11:00:05 BST\n\nHi Michelle, thanks for your help!\n\nI tried out editing the xml and found a new problem (sorry!!!!!!)\n\n1. when I use german characters in labels ("gut für") the whole xml wont be\nread.

You might consider using one or more of the existing web standards\nfor defining search engine interactions, such as OpenSearch and/or Sherlock,\nand let me download pre-defined search plugins from the web.\nhttp://mycroft.mozdev.org/ claims to have over 23,000 search plugins for\nvarious browsers...it would be nice if Compendium could download and use these\nrather than requiring me to describe the search protocol myself.

So, for example, if Bugzilla search lets\nme specify (a) keywords (b) bug status (c) bug ID and (d) opened-by, all of\nthese would be text fields or drop-downs (as appropriate), created based on the\ndefinition of the search plugin. (Bonus points if the search plugin''s icon is\ndisplayed as the Reference node icon.)\n\nAlso, I think that if you reworked the Reference UI in this way, you could also\nextend this to handle internal reference nodes more elegantly: if I select\n"Internal" from the reference type drop-down, the UI could change to some kind\nof graphical selector that allows me to choose a node from one of my maps,\nright from the dialog box. This would be instead of that very cryptic comp://\nURL that you currently allow me to edit (but warn me not to touch in the help\nfiles).\n\nProbably also related to 974.\n\nAlso, it would be super-cool if there were some really efficient way to create\nReference nodes using certain search engines. For example, if I have a search\nplugin that targets http://www.biblegateway.com, I''d like to be able to use a\nhot-key to insert a Reference using this plugin, and then just type the search\ntext as the node label (e.g., "John 3:16"), and have the primary search field\nauto-populated with this value, without me ever having to open up the contents\ndialog box.')

In that spirit, I think I will lay out the\nfull cluster of features I would like to have ideally.\n\nI have been corresponding with a number of people, here and elsewhere,\nabout our mutual desire to be able to build a dialogue map collectively (but\nperhaps asynchronously) in a manner analogous to the construction of the\nWikipedia. I know that there are people here working on, or at least thinking\nof working on, this goal. \n\nTo a version of Compendium that supports dialogue maps created in this fashion,\nI would like to add an "AutoWiki" feature. It would look something like this:\n\nWe start with a map that is editable by any group member (with good \n"restore" and history functions!!). When the AutoWiki feature is\nturned on, we require that as the map is constructed, each node and\nline be named meaningfully, using the common wiki "CamelCase" naming\nconvention. You would need a special procedure to add such names if\nyou turn it on for an existing map without them. The meaningful names\nwould be used in addition to or in place of the existing automatically\ngenerated tags for linking purposes.\n\nAutoWiki will then automatically create a reciprocally connected wiki\npage of the same name, with the usual assortment of wiki features and tools for\nboth common text and dialogue about that text. \n\nWithin the wiki, use of a PageName creates a link to the named page\nin the usual way. But for page created with AutoWiki, the PageName link at the\ntop of the page takes you to the same-named link or node in the dialogue map.\n\nEach page would also have an assortment of finders'' tools accessible\nfrom it. These could include automatically generated pairs of links,\none to each node to which it is connected and one to the corresponding\npage; a pop-up index of all the pages on which that page/node name\noccurs; and a link to an automatically generated alphabetical list of\nall the pages and nodes in the system.\n\nI am not sure if documentation and evidence should be attached to the the map\nor the wiki page. I''m also not sure what you do with a page, or documentation\nattached to a page, if the node is deleted. Maybe a bin for deleted structures?\n\nAs someone who is not a professional programmer, I may be kidding myself about\nhow hard it would be to create such a system, but I do want to observe that\nwikis are generally open-source and that all wikis have easy standard features\nfor creating a page with a specified name and for automatically creating live\nlinks to that page wherever in the wiki the name is used. Most also have\nstructured discussion features such as those mentioned above as options. As a\nresult, i think it would be possible to add a lot of functionality to\nCompendium for a modest investment of effort. And of course you would not need\nevery thing i mentioned on the first pass. For example, some of the finders''\ntools could be\nadded later.\n\nOf all of the features embodied in this request, the ones that I think are most\ncritical to allowing the uses of Compendium to foster dialogs with distributed\nparticipants is the ability to give each node and link a unique, meaningful tag\n(â€œhandleâ€), ideally user-chosen, a convenient way to insert a link to\nanother website, and an easy way for distributed participants to learn the\nhandles and the associated url''s (perhaps by having a window from which it can\nbe copied pop up on hover) so that they can link to or from the node or line\nwith the specified handle. With these facilities and no more, a moderator could\nelaborate the dialogue map as it emerges from the discussion on a related site,\nand manual but easy and intuitive tools for linking back and fort from the map\nto discussions that take place on a related site (in any of a wide range of\nformats) could be constructed. \n\nIt would be even nicer if these tools could be automated, of course. And it\nwould be nice if several alternative visual and informational structures for\nthe related dialogue could be used â€“ threaded discussion, wiki, â€œyahoo\ngroupâ€-style forum, etc. â€“ though I think it is far more important to get\none up and working well than to get several that sort-of work most of the time. \n\nReturning to for a moment to the question of allowing distributed users to\nbuild a map, I have nothing to contribute on the technical side of this\ndiscussion, but I want to add a word or two from the perspective of a\nprospective user.\n\nThere are many, many cases where you want to bring a group of people together\nto engage in a discussion of make a decision where the commitment of the people\ninvolved is limited and the organizers do not have direct authority over the\nparticipants nor the resources to compensate (or threaten) them. This is the\n_typical_ situation in collaborative processes in the NGO setting, were I work,\nand a common one in academia, user groups, and many other settings. \n\nIn this setting it is essential that the cost of entry be low and the rewards\nimmediate. Organizers of this sort of process may have significant investment\nin making them go well, and can be asked to spend some time climbing the\nlearning curve. Also, once a participant has bought into a process and become\ninvested in its methods and outcome the participants are often willing to\ndevote genuine resources to making it work. But before such buy-in takes place,\neven quite minor barriers will cause potentially valuable participants to put\ntheir energy elsewhere.\n\nSomething I would put in the category, not of a minor barrier, but of a\nsignificant one, would be the requirement that participants install a piece of\nsoftware and learn how to use it. For most of the on-line dialogues I deal with\non a daily basis, this would be enough to guarantee that the process collapses\nbefore it gets properly started. I would therefore strongly urge that if there\nis any way to make the system work with a web-based interface, or some other\nsystem that uses software with which people believe themselves to be familiar,\neven at the cost of some functionality.\n\nIt is worth observing that people generally feel like they know what a browser\nis and what it does, even though they lack any technical understanding of the\nprocess. Moreover, I have observed that this familiarity can result in people\nfeeling like they are using software that they know how to use, even where the\nprocedure that they must use on a remote page is quite different from what they\nmost often do. This is especially true where the actions can be identified with\ncommon actions that people take on web pages, such as making a choice by\npoint-and-click, filling out a form, etc. Remember that most people know how to\nuse yahoo groups and the like, a few with using wikis, and not many with any\ngraphical representation system.\n\nAndrew Hoerner\nhoerner@redefiningprogress.org\n\nComment 1 Michelle Bachler 2006-11-27 11:48:37 GMT\n\n*** Bug 244 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***\n\nComment 2 Eugene Eric Kim 2007-01-25 19:58:28 GMT\n\nI agree that there''s great potential in having distributed, multiuser maps,\nalthough I have doubts about using existing Web-based tools to create these\nmaps.\n\nThat said, I''d like to point out that the functionality described here is\npossible without any modifications to the core Compendium code.

The most obvious of these is the top/left/right\nnavigation bars -- on a site with many pages, you wouldn''t want to\nhave to maintain these on every individual page if they basically are\nthe same across many pages.\n\nAlong with our (blessed) ability to have map backgrounds that can be\nany sort of graphic/layout, I think we need some kind of "include"\nability, similar to HTML includes, that can place not just single\nobjects (e.g. a graphic) but something like portions of other maps\nonto our maps.\n\nFor example, you could have a map that has a set of map nodes that\njust takes up the very top of a map (like the top navigation bar on a\nwebsite). I''d like the capability to "include"/transclude that map on\nthe top of another map.\n\nThat way you could just maintain the top navigation in one place in\nyour project, but have it update on all the other maps it''s\nincluded/transcluded in.\n\nObviously this is a big change to how we handle things today, but it\nwould be extremely useful not only for web publishing but also\nprojects like Co-OPR that have repeating navigation on many maps.\n\nFrom Maarten:\nMy only thought at the moment is to use something like templates in MediaWiki:\n\n"In MediaWiki, a template is a page which can be inserted into another page via\na process called transclusion. It is a wiki subroutine or iframe facility and\nis comparable to a #include statement or macro that is expanded at page view\ntime. Substitution allows templates to be used as a macro facility."\n\nMy response:\nI wonder if there is some way to do that within Compendium itself. Failing\nthat, we could at least (and more easily) do something on the HTML export\nlevel. We do have an enhancement on the list (for a long time) to allow custom\nHTML header and footer files to be added for web exports, this could be part of\nthat. But it would be better if it could be done working within Compendium, not\nrequiring HTML coding knowledge.')

The\nTOC was done as a quick summer student project in 2001 and was never intended\nto be the permanent way.\n\n2) When you export without the TOC etc., have an option to have a friendlier\nURL for the top page (the map you exported from) than the default map title +\nIP address + time (e.g. "Publications_19216811011164221841074.html". I know the\nlong URL is necessary for uniquely identifying the map in the case that there\nare multiple maps with the same names, but what I''m proposing is that the\nfriendly URL be in addition to the verbose one. What could happen is that, if\nyou select that option, you create an HTML redirect that redirects the friendly\nURL to the verbose one.\n\nFor example: Your friendly URL would be "Publications.html"; the export would\ngenerate a web page with a simple redirect on it (and maybe the customary "this\npage should redirect, if not here''s the direct link to the new page) to\n"Publications_19216811011164221841074.html".\n\nThis would remove the need to have to create tinyURLs.')

Somewhere in the menus (probably "Tools")\nthere''s an item that opens up a "search manager" or some such, in which I can\nspecify URLs and query string formats for interacting with various sites on the\nInternet. You might consider using one or more of the existing web standards\nfor defining search engine interactions, such as OpenSearch and/or Sherlock,\nand let me download pre-defined search plugins from the web.\nhttp://mycroft.mozdev.org/ claims to have over 23,000 search plugins for\nvarious browsers...it would be nice if Compendium could download and use these\nrather than requiring me to describe the search protocol myself. (Bonus points\nif Compendium automatically checks for updates to the plugins every so often!)\n\nAnyway, however the search plugins get created, once I have them registered\nwith Compendium, I''d like to be able to create Reference nodes that use them\ninstead of requiring me to input a URL. I think this could be done in the UI by\nmigrating the current Reference-specific fields into their own "Reference" tab\nalongside "Contents", "Properties" and "Views". In this tab, the first UI\nelement would be a drop-down box that lets me choose "URL" (in order to get the\ncurrent Reference behavior) or any of my currently registered search plugins.\nThe rest of the UI in this tab would change based on the variable fields\nspecific to my selected search plugin. So, for example, if Bugzilla search lets\nme specify (a) keywords (b) bug status (c) bug ID and (d) opened-by, all of\nthese would be text fields or drop-downs (as appropriate), created based on the\ndefinition of the search plugin. (Bonus points if the search plugin''s icon is\ndisplayed as the Reference node icon.)\n\nAlso, I think that if you reworked the Reference UI in this way, you could also\nextend this to handle internal reference nodes more elegantly: if I select\n"Internal" from the reference type drop-down, the UI could change to some kind\nof graphical selector that allows me to choose a node from one of my maps,\nright from the dialog box. This would be instead of that very cryptic comp://\nURL that you currently allow me to edit (but warn me not to touch in the help\nfiles).\n\nProbably also related to 974.\n\nComment 3 Ryan Saunders 2011-06-19 07:49:48 BST\n\nAlso, it would be super-cool if there were some really efficient way to create\nReference nodes using certain search engines. For example, if I have a search\nplugin that targets http://www.biblegateway.com, I''d like to be able to use a\nhot-key to insert a Reference using this plugin, and then just type the search\ntext as the node label (e.g., "John 3:16"), and have this the main search field\nauto-populated with this value, without me ever having to open up the contents\ndialog box.\n\nComment 4 Michelle Bachler 2011-06-20 12:19:15 BST\n\nI think this is a completely new feature request you have descibed here. This\nitem is only talking about Compendium''s internal search interface, adding\nnetwork search and such. \n\nCan you please create a new item for what you have described.\n\nThanks\n\nMichelle\n\nComment 5 Ryan Saunders 2011-06-24 08:44:50 BST\n\nDone, as issue 1002.\n\n')

As you are unlikely to keep chaning it, it should not\nbe too onerous.\n\ngo to: <compendium dir>/Systems/resources/LinkGroups\nopen the xml file for your new linkgroup in a text editor.\n\nEach link is represented by a line in the file, which can be broken down as\nfollows:\n\n<linktype \nid="46" \nname="About" \ncolour="-16711681" \nlabel="" \narrowtype="1" \nlinkstyle="1" \nlinkdashed="0" \nlinkweight="1" \n/>\n\nid: leave the id number alone.\n\nname: the name as it appears in the link type lists.\n\ncolour: this would not be easy to add as these are generaled from java colours,\nso you could copy ones around from the default for now.\n\nlabel: any default text yopu want to automatically appear in the link when it\nis created.\n\narrowtypes options: \nNO_ARROW        = 0;\nARROW_TO        = 1;\nARROW_FROM        = 2;\nARROW_TO_AND_FROM    = 3;\n\nlinkstyle options:\n\nSTRAIGHT_LINK        = 0;\nCURVED_LINK        = 1;\nSQUARE_LINK        = 2;\n\nlinkdashed options:\n\nPLAIN_LINE        = 0;\nLARGE_DASHED_LINE    = 1;\nSMALL_DASHED_LINE    = 2;\n\nlinkweight: just a number count 1,2,3,4 etc representing thickness.\n\nHopefully this workaround will help until the beta 2 comes out.\n\nMichelle\n\n')

It is not bad when you''re doing single tags here\nand there, but not so good when doing multiple tags in different combinations\nin rapid succession.\n\nCouple of things I thought of (besides the kb shortcuts in the works):\n\n- have a copy/paste special or similar action that would copy just the tags\nfrom one node and paste special them onto others (similar to Excel paste\nspecial formats or values)\n\n- have a "Tag Again" command (or Redo or similar action) that would apply the\nsame tag set as last done\n\nAlso I noticed that Alt-X didn''t work when more than one node was selected.\n\nAnother kind of problematic thing about the current UI is that (as Maarten has\npointed out) it takes too many clicks to assign multiple tags. A lot of times I\nleft out one of the many steps and ended up closing the dialog without having\nactually assigned any tags. Even with the kb shortcuts coming, we still need a\nbetter UI for ''power-tagging''... I don''t have any clear ideas although the\nabove may help. I''ll try to enlist my volunteer UI design corps to think about\nit.\n\nAl\n12/2005\n\nMay now be addressed by new Tags interface w/1.5.1 (AMS)\n(from old db, medium list)')

In this case, if it were switched on (via a checkbox in the Node\nProperties dialog), a rollover would perform an action like show a full-size\ngraphic, play a sound, even play a movie clip.

The behavior I have in mind is just like a web page rollover --\nsomething appears as part of the existing view on rollover, not a separate\nwindow, etc.\n\nAl\n\n\nHi,\n\nIt''s not the effort that''s the issue so much as the flow in a presentation or\nnarrative mode. Double-clicking to launch a separate application (then having\nto close it again) can be disruptive, just as it would be if you had to do it\non a web page to see a rollover image. There are times when\ndouble-clicking/launching is desirable (the present state), but other times\nwhen a smooth flow is desirable and double-clicking/launching would disrupt\nthat flow.\n\nSo my idea is that double-clicking/launching is the default as at present, but\nrollover behavior is an option. I do like the idea of having a particular icon\nor area of the node to roll over to invoke the rollover behavior (to avoid the\nproblem of "unintentional rollover" that you point out).

Bruce Kimball 2009-06-18 17:53:48 BST\n\nI have this need as well, and have been very successful as follows... Extract\nall text-only content of the attached documents and place it into page 2 and\nbeyond of the notes for the reference node. With a PDF, for example, you can\nusually select-all (if it is not just an image), copy and paste. A spreadsheet\ncan be exported as a csv. Similar tricks work with HTML and other document\ntypes. I prefer to do this on page 2 and beyond so that my "key word index"\ndoes not come up in the mouseovers, reserving page one of the notes for "real"\nnotes which I do wish to see on the mouseovers. I learned that search was not\nworking on page 2+ of the notes, but this has now been fixed (see bug #781).\nI''m not sure when we will have it in a downloadable release, but I am looking\nforward to this fix! My workaround in the meanwhile is to leave "real notes" at\nthe top of page one, and push all of the text for searching down on a sometimes\nvery long page one. You can also build a "key word or search-terms index" for\neach doc in the notes of course, which would also work if you need only a few\ncritical terms. I find it pretty effortless and useful just to throw in the\nentire content. Perhaps you would like to sneak this tip into the documentation\non searching, since I suspect this will be a common feature request (searching\non reference documents).\n\n')
