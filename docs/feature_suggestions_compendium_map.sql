Architecturally, we are unable to use either\nthe MySQL or Apache Derby databases and any database that we do use cannot be\ninstalled locally on a user machine.  Our development teams have looked at the\npossibility of modifying the code to support a SQL Server or Oracle DBMS and\nutilise a central database however their estimates of the effort involve\nindicate a significant cost to this.  I was wondering if any other companies\nmay have undertaken this work already and submitted it back to yourselves for\ndistribution or whether this is something the compendium team are working on\nfor a future release.\n\nMany thanks,\nTrevor Davies\nTechnical Architect\nBritish Energy\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 1 Michelle Bachler 2007-06-13 12:50:11 BST\n\nNo, unfortunately not and we have no plans at present to extend the system to\nsupport further databases. You can submit a feature request for this, and it\nwill be considered along with all others, but it is unlikely to become a\npriority for us at present. This is the sort of area that we hoped external\ndevelopers would contribute in though.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 2 Dirk Gorissen 2010-02-16 08:46:38 GMT\n\nIts been more than two years since this post but it is an issue I am also\ninterested in.  From the mailinglist I understood that still no work has been\ndone in this direction.\n\nI loaded the code into eclipse and it all looks quite clean and well\nstructured.  The SQL looks fairly standard as well so Im almost tempted to give\nit a shot.  The only problem is the distinction between Derby and MySQL is made\nusing constants and methods with different names, spread across different\nclasses.  Adding versions for SQLServer is probably not the cleanest way to go\nabout this.  \n\nAnyway, if I do produce some working code I will post it here.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 3 Michelle Bachler 2010-02-16 11:56:34 GMT\n\nYes, sorry about that.\nAt some point I wanted to abstract it all more, so it was easier to add new\ndatabase types.

(If not, I''ll go create a new request.)\n\nThanks,\nChris\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 5 Michelle Bachler 2010-10-21 16:12:20 BST\n\nNo, this is asking for support for using SQL Server  / Oracle instead od Derby\nand MySQL databases.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 6 Dirk Gorissen 2010-10-25 16:20:36 BST\n\nIndeed, but it is no longer important for us.

It is nice if _you_ think in those terms, but it is not\nnice to impose that style of thinking upon, say, _me_, or others, necessarily.\n\nAnd then, as a result of this imposed "structure", the "canned" icons dominate\nthe mind-map, to the exclusion of the idea being expressed in the node.  The\nicons are large, attention-grabbing, and the text seems small and bothersome\nnext to them.  And then, the symbols surrounding the icons are arcane to the\nnew user, or worse, to the non-user.\n\nAnd this leads to an additional shortcoming - I want to use the mind-map to\n_communicate_ to another person.  I want them to be able to "see" my ideas, not\nsome arcane "structure" and classification system.  It''s as if, the developers\nare so proud of their mind-mapping system, that the "system" over-shadows any\nconcepts that some user might want to use the system to express.\n\nAnd then, in these different "nodes", there are too many data types, as if,\nsay, a "list" is some dramatically different thing from, say, a "paragraph". \nThe _concepts_ being expressed are important to emphasize, but not the _way_\nthese concepts are being expressed.  The "tree" should be modeled as "flat" and\nvisible, rather than "deep" and invisible.  It''s a communication - not a\n"treasure hunt".\n\nMaybe as I learn more about it, it will make more sense...\n\n\nJames',0,'compendiumng')

Somewhere in the menus (probably "Tools")\nthere''s an item that opens up a "search manager" or some such, in which I can\nspecify URLs and query string formats for interacting with various sites on the\nInternet. You might consider using one or more of the existing web standards\nfor defining search engine interactions, such as OpenSearch and/or Sherlock,\nand let me download pre-defined search plugins from the web.\nhttp://mycroft.mozdev.org/ claims to have over 23,000 search plugins for\nvarious browsers...it would be nice if Compendium could download and use these\nrather than requiring me to describe the search protocol myself. (Bonus points\nif Compendium automatically checks for updates to the plugins every so often!)\n\nAnyway, however the search plugins get created, once I have them registered\nwith Compendium, I''d like to be able to create Reference nodes that use them\ninstead of requiring me to input a URL. I think this could be done in the UI by\nmigrating the current Reference-specific fields into their own "Reference" tab\nalongside "Contents", "Properties" and "Views". In this tab, the first UI\nelement would be a drop-down box that lets me choose "URL" (in order to get the\ncurrent Reference behavior) or any of my currently registered search plugins.\nThe rest of the UI in this tab would change based on the variable fields\nspecific to my selected search plugin. So, for example, if Bugzilla search lets\nme specify (a) keywords (b) bug status (c) bug ID and (d) opened-by, all of\nthese would be text fields or drop-downs (as appropriate), created based on the\ndefinition of the search plugin. (Bonus points if the search plugin''s icon is\ndisplayed as the Reference node icon.)\n\nAlso, I think that if you reworked the Reference UI in this way, you could also\nextend this to handle internal reference nodes more elegantly: if I select\n"Internal" from the reference type drop-down, the UI could change to some kind\nof graphical selector that allows me to choose a node from one of my maps,\nright from the dialog box. This would be instead of that very cryptic comp://\nURL that you currently allow me to edit (but warn me not to touch in the help\nfiles).\n\nProbably also related to 974.\n\nAlso, it would be super-cool if there were some really efficient way to create\nReference nodes using certain search engines. For example, if I have a search\nplugin that targets http://www.biblegateway.com, I''d like to be able to use a\nhot-key to insert a Reference using this plugin, and then just type the search\ntext as the node label (e.g., "John 3:16"), and have the primary search field\nauto-populated with this value, without me ever having to open up the contents\ndialog box.',0,'compendiumng')

Architecturally, we are unable to use either\nthe MySQL or Apache Derby databases and any database that we do use cannot be\ninstalled locally on a user machine.  Our development teams have looked at the\npossibility of modifying the code to support a SQL Server or Oracle DBMS and\nutilise a central database however their estimates of the effort involve\nindicate a significant cost to this.  I was wondering if any other companies\nmay have undertaken this work already and submitted it back to yourselves for\ndistribution or whether this is something the compendium team are working on\nfor a future release.\n\nMany thanks,\nTrevor Davies\nTechnical Architect\nBritish Energy\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 1 Michelle Bachler 2007-06-13 12:50:11 BST\n\nNo, unfortunately not and we have no plans at present to extend the system to\nsupport further databases. You can submit a feature request for this, and it\nwill be considered along with all others, but it is unlikely to become a\npriority for us at present. This is the sort of area that we hoped external\ndevelopers would contribute in though.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 2 Dirk Gorissen 2010-02-16 08:46:38 GMT\n\nIts been more than two years since this post but it is an issue I am also\ninterested in.  From the mailinglist I understood that still no work has been\ndone in this direction.\n\nI loaded the code into eclipse and it all looks quite clean and well\nstructured.  The SQL looks fairly standard as well so Im almost tempted to give\nit a shot.  The only problem is the distinction between Derby and MySQL is made\nusing constants and methods with different names, spread across different\nclasses.  Adding versions for SQLServer is probably not the cleanest way to go\nabout this.  \n\nAnyway, if I do produce some working code I will post it here.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 3 Michelle Bachler 2010-02-16 11:56:34 GMT\n\nYes, sorry about that.\nAt some point I wanted to abstract it all more, so it was easier to add new\ndatabase types.

(If not, I''ll go create a new request.)\n\nThanks,\nChris\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 5 Michelle Bachler 2010-10-21 16:12:20 BST\n\nNo, this is asking for support for using SQL Server  / Oracle instead od Derby\nand MySQL databases.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 6 Dirk Gorissen 2010-10-25 16:20:36 BST\n\nIndeed, but it is no longer important for us.

It is nice if _you_ think in those terms, but it is not\nnice to impose that style of thinking upon, say, _me_, or others, necessarily.\n\nAnd then, as a result of this imposed "structure", the "canned" icons dominate\nthe mind-map, to the exclusion of the idea being expressed in the node.  The\nicons are large, attention-grabbing, and the text seems small and bothersome\nnext to them.  And then, the symbols surrounding the icons are arcane to the\nnew user, or worse, to the non-user.\n\nAnd this leads to an additional shortcoming - I want to use the mind-map to\n_communicate_ to another person.  I want them to be able to "see" my ideas, not\nsome arcane "structure" and classification system.  It''s as if, the developers\nare so proud of their mind-mapping system, that the "system" over-shadows any\nconcepts that some user might want to use the system to express.\n\nAnd then, in these different "nodes", there are too many data types, as if,\nsay, a "list" is some dramatically different thing from, say, a "paragraph". \nThe _concepts_ being expressed are important to emphasize, but not the _way_\nthese concepts are being expressed.  The "tree" should be modeled as "flat" and\nvisible, rather than "deep" and invisible.  It''s a communication - not a\n"treasure hunt".\n\nMaybe as I learn more about it, it will make more sense...\n\n\nJames')

I feel this to be a barrier to join in the further development\nof what looks like something the knowledge worker can''t do without.\n\nThe world direly needs more powerful tools to harness the ever increasing flood\nof detailed, and often pieces-of-the-puzzle-like knowledge. In my view people\nworking on Compendium seem to be exploring in the right direction.....\n\nSomehow it feels like a methodology/tool with a steep learning curve. If there\nwould be a more gradual learning curve from newbie to master - many more people\nwould start adopting, and endorsing the project! I personally feel what is most\nneeded are well structured tutorials starting from "absolute newbie" through to\n"Compendium master".\n\nFrom my side I would appreciate human contact to see if my contributions could\nbe helpful... if the feeling is mutual: martinjzu@gmail.com or call Netherlands\n0413248833\n\nKind regards, and a happy and healthy 2011\n\nMartin van Zanten')

Somewhere in the menus (probably "Tools")\nthere''s an item that opens up a "search manager" or some such, in which I can\nspecify URLs and query string formats for interacting with various sites on the\nInternet. You might consider using one or more of the existing web standards\nfor defining search engine interactions, such as OpenSearch and/or Sherlock,\nand let me download pre-defined search plugins from the web.\nhttp://mycroft.mozdev.org/ claims to have over 23,000 search plugins for\nvarious browsers...it would be nice if Compendium could download and use these\nrather than requiring me to describe the search protocol myself. (Bonus points\nif Compendium automatically checks for updates to the plugins every so often!)\n\nAnyway, however the search plugins get created, once I have them registered\nwith Compendium, I''d like to be able to create Reference nodes that use them\ninstead of requiring me to input a URL. I think this could be done in the UI by\nmigrating the current Reference-specific fields into their own "Reference" tab\nalongside "Contents", "Properties" and "Views". In this tab, the first UI\nelement would be a drop-down box that lets me choose "URL" (in order to get the\ncurrent Reference behavior) or any of my currently registered search plugins.\nThe rest of the UI in this tab would change based on the variable fields\nspecific to my selected search plugin. So, for example, if Bugzilla search lets\nme specify (a) keywords (b) bug status (c) bug ID and (d) opened-by, all of\nthese would be text fields or drop-downs (as appropriate), created based on the\ndefinition of the search plugin. (Bonus points if the search plugin''s icon is\ndisplayed as the Reference node icon.)\n\nAlso, I think that if you reworked the Reference UI in this way, you could also\nextend this to handle internal reference nodes more elegantly: if I select\n"Internal" from the reference type drop-down, the UI could change to some kind\nof graphical selector that allows me to choose a node from one of my maps,\nright from the dialog box. This would be instead of that very cryptic comp://\nURL that you currently allow me to edit (but warn me not to touch in the help\nfiles).\n\nProbably also related to 974.\n\nAlso, it would be super-cool if there were some really efficient way to create\nReference nodes using certain search engines. For example, if I have a search\nplugin that targets http://www.biblegateway.com, I''d like to be able to use a\nhot-key to insert a Reference using this plugin, and then just type the search\ntext as the node label (e.g., "John 3:16"), and have the primary search field\nauto-populated with this value, without me ever having to open up the contents\ndialog box.')
