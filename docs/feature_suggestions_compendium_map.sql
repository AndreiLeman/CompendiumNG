Architecturally, we are unable to use either\nthe MySQL or Apache Derby databases and any database that we do use cannot be\ninstalled locally on a user machine.  Our development teams have looked at the\npossibility of modifying the code to support a SQL Server or Oracle DBMS and\nutilise a central database however their estimates of the effort involve\nindicate a significant cost to this.  I was wondering if any other companies\nmay have undertaken this work already and submitted it back to yourselves for\ndistribution or whether this is something the compendium team are working on\nfor a future release.\n\nMany thanks,\nTrevor Davies\nTechnical Architect\nBritish Energy\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 1 Michelle Bachler 2007-06-13 12:50:11 BST\n\nNo, unfortunately not and we have no plans at present to extend the system to\nsupport further databases. You can submit a feature request for this, and it\nwill be considered along with all others, but it is unlikely to become a\npriority for us at present. This is the sort of area that we hoped external\ndevelopers would contribute in though.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 2 Dirk Gorissen 2010-02-16 08:46:38 GMT\n\nIts been more than two years since this post but it is an issue I am also\ninterested in.  From the mailinglist I understood that still no work has been\ndone in this direction.\n\nI loaded the code into eclipse and it all looks quite clean and well\nstructured.  The SQL looks fairly standard as well so Im almost tempted to give\nit a shot.  The only problem is the distinction between Derby and MySQL is made\nusing constants and methods with different names, spread across different\nclasses.  Adding versions for SQLServer is probably not the cleanest way to go\nabout this.  \n\nAnyway, if I do produce some working code I will post it here.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 3 Michelle Bachler 2010-02-16 11:56:34 GMT\n\nYes, sorry about that.\nAt some point I wanted to abstract it all more, so it was easier to add new\ndatabase types.

It''s certainly not an absent\nminded momentary triviality to create a consistent style (which deviates\nsignificantly from the default) within a map or between maps (for nodes, links,\nbackgrounds, text, etc.)\n\nI think the qualitative experience of using Compendium could be improved hugely\nmerely by improving the fluency of style management.\n\ni suggest using style palettes. \n\nBy "palette" i mean, for each compendium element that can have style: a list of\nstyles available for selection. \n* Each compendium element will have its own style list.\n* The style list will have a default where a new compendium elements is created\nwith the default style. The default can be changed.\n* The list can added to by selection of a compendium element and copying its\nstyle to the list, the new style being nameable. (eg. select compendium item,\nclick a menu strip button or rt click and "add to style list")\n* The list can have items renamed and deleted.\n\nI suppose the compendium elements are: node, link and map(open).  Maybe each\nnode type could have its own style palette.\n\neg. for a link style, i should be able to set all the qualities for a link\n(including text), and save it to a name in the link style palette.  I should\nalso be able to select one or a number of links and click a "style button" to\napply that style onto the element(s).\n\nsimilarly for nodes and maps.\n\n... just to go further out on the limb ...\nrather than have the style palette defaults be global, it might be useful to\nhave:\neach map have its own set of element style defaults (to make it easier for each\nmap to maintain its style).\n... also, if each map has its own collection of element style defaults, then a\nnew map created within this map could inherit that set of defaults.\n\nto reiterate: I think the qualitative experience of using Compendium could be\nimproved hugely merely by improving the fluency of style management.\n\nComment 1 Al Selvin 2011-02-06 18:05:31 GMT\n\nJust a comment. \n\nYou can do many of these things already in Compendium by setting Project or\nUser Options (Tools menu), as well as by creating custom Link Groups, Stencils,\nand other means.\n\nHaving said that, it could always be easier to do.

Unfortunately, it''s not easy to create space on the Compendium background\nfor new windows.  Windows can''t have their boundaries moved beyond the\nbackground boundary.  That means there''s a lot of window management activity in\nresponse to something conceptually simple.\n\nAlso, because mysql projects can be accessed across different pcs (with\ndifferent screen dimensions) then this means a map that opened ok on one\nscreen, may be too large for another screen - despite not being designed for\nthis eventuality.  This means some fiddly window management required to "pull\nin" the map boundary from beyond the edge of the background boundary.\n\nfeature request:\n================\nA solution to this could be to allow window to be designed to be moved such\nthat their boundaries go beyond the background boundary.

I also use the Workspaces system to layout and remember\narrangements of maps I use a lot.The Window Menu also has the usual Cascade and\ntile options (which would recover Windows if they left the visible area). \n\nIn older versions of Compendium windows they could leave the visible area. But\nthen we had complaints about lost windows going off the edge and then I think I\nadded the constraint that the Windows had to stay. I started writting a scroll\nmechanism so Windows could go off, but you could scroll to them. I had issues\ngetting this working and it was buggy. So for a quick fix I just stopped\nWindows leaving the area. It is something I need to go back to.\n\nMichelle',0,'compendiumng')

In order to participate in the\ntimeline view, the node would probably need to be manually dated, as the\nmodification date of the node is probably not meaningful in this context.\n\nHere''s an example of how I envision this working. Suppose I''m investigating the\nhistorical development of an idea (for example, the concept of a "canon of\nscripture" in Judaism and Christianity). In the course of my research, I\naccumulate various quotations from relevant ancient and modern writers and I\nstuff them into Reference nodes, which I tag with dates indicating my best\nguess of what year each quotation was written. These quotations are probably\nsupporting facts in the argument structure of one or more of my map views, but\nI also want to see how they relate to one another chronologically, so I\ncopy/paste them into a timeline view. Then, to provide additional context, I\ncreate additional nodes directly in the timeline view representing the dates of\nvarious events (e.g., the Council of Trent) and the lifespans of the relevant\nfigures (e.g., the life of Eusebius). In this way, I construct a visual\nchronology of the topic I''m investigating, with each node in the timeline being\nhyperlinked to references, related events and/or argumentation related to that\nevent.\n\nOne issue to keep in mind is that dates of ancient events are generally\nimprecise, and sometimes disputed. Thus, the date that a particular event\nhappened (e.g., the composition of the document known as "the Gospel according\nto Mark") could be the subject of one of the Questions under argumentation,\nwith different authors proposing different dates and arguing for their\nproposals, and the user might make a Decision regarding this issue. In my\nopinion, the timeline view should be able to indicate (a) spans of time (e.g.,\nby drawing the event as a rectangle rather than as a single point in time) as\nwell as (b) uncertainty/debate regarding a date/span (e.g., by drawing the\nuncertain time span as a fade-out from fully opaque to fully transparent.\n\nThe timeline view might be even more useful if, instead of having to manually\ncopy/paste nodes into the timeline view, I can instead link the timeline view\nto one or more map/list views, so that anything in one of those views with an\nassociated date is automatically plotted on the timeline. This would make it\nharder for things to get out-of-sync between my various views, since I only\nneed to worry about dating the various nodes, and not also copy/pasting them.\nOne additional enhancement could make it _impossible_ for things to get\nout-of-sync: if I could set a constraint on my map/list view that says\n"everything in here is required to have a date", then Compendium could help me\nby complaining "hey, you need to give this node a date!". Or, alternately,\nnodes in the linked views that don''t have dates could be drawn in a "date\nunknown" region of the timeline, which would be a way of visually notifying me\nthat I''d forgotten to date something.',0,'compendiumng')

And then, the symbols surrounding the icons are arcane to the\nnew user, or worse, to the non-user.\n\nAnd this leads to an additional shortcoming - I want to use the mind-map to\n_communicate_ to another person.  I want them to be able to "see" my ideas, not\nsome arcane "structure" and classification system.

The "tree" should be modeled as "flat" and\nvisible, rather than "deep" and invisible.

Somewhere in the menus (probably "Tools")\nthere''s an item that opens up a "search manager" or some such, in which I can\nspecify URLs and query string formats for interacting with various sites on the\nInternet. You might consider using one or more of the existing web standards\nfor defining search engine interactions, such as OpenSearch and/or Sherlock,\nand let me download pre-defined search plugins from the web.\nhttp://mycroft.mozdev.org/ claims to have over 23,000 search plugins for\nvarious browsers...it would be nice if Compendium could download and use these\nrather than requiring me to describe the search protocol myself. (Bonus points\nif Compendium automatically checks for updates to the plugins every so often!)\n\nAnyway, however the search plugins get created, once I have them registered\nwith Compendium, I''d like to be able to create Reference nodes that use them\ninstead of requiring me to input a URL. I think this could be done in the UI by\nmigrating the current Reference-specific fields into their own "Reference" tab\nalongside "Contents", "Properties" and "Views". In this tab, the first UI\nelement would be a drop-down box that lets me choose "URL" (in order to get the\ncurrent Reference behavior) or any of my currently registered search plugins.\nThe rest of the UI in this tab would change based on the variable fields\nspecific to my selected search plugin. So, for example, if Bugzilla search lets\nme specify (a) keywords (b) bug status (c) bug ID and (d) opened-by, all of\nthese would be text fields or drop-downs (as appropriate), created based on the\ndefinition of the search plugin. (Bonus points if the search plugin''s icon is\ndisplayed as the Reference node icon.)\n\nAlso, I think that if you reworked the Reference UI in this way, you could also\nextend this to handle internal reference nodes more elegantly: if I select\n"Internal" from the reference type drop-down, the UI could change to some kind\nof graphical selector that allows me to choose a node from one of my maps,\nright from the dialog box. This would be instead of that very cryptic comp://\nURL that you currently allow me to edit (but warn me not to touch in the help\nfiles).\n\nProbably also related to 974.\n\nAlso, it would be super-cool if there were some really efficient way to create\nReference nodes using certain search engines. For example, if I have a search\nplugin that targets http://www.biblegateway.com, I''d like to be able to use a\nhot-key to insert a Reference using this plugin, and then just type the search\ntext as the node label (e.g., "John 3:16"), and have the primary search field\nauto-populated with this value, without me ever having to open up the contents\ndialog box.',0,'compendiumng')

In that spirit, I think I will lay out the\nfull cluster of features I would like to have ideally.\n\nI have been corresponding with a number of people, here and elsewhere,\nabout our mutual desire to be able to build a dialogue map collectively (but\nperhaps asynchronously) in a manner analogous to the construction of the\nWikipedia. I know that there are people here working on, or at least thinking\nof working on, this goal. \n\nTo a version of Compendium that supports dialogue maps created in this fashion,\nI would like to add an "AutoWiki" feature. It would look something like this:\n\nWe start with a map that is editable by any group member (with good \n"restore" and history functions!!). When the AutoWiki feature is\nturned on, we require that as the map is constructed, each node and\nline be named meaningfully, using the common wiki "CamelCase" naming\nconvention. You would need a special procedure to add such names if\nyou turn it on for an existing map without them. The meaningful names\nwould be used in addition to or in place of the existing automatically\ngenerated tags for linking purposes.\n\nAutoWiki will then automatically create a reciprocally connected wiki\npage of the same name, with the usual assortment of wiki features and tools for\nboth common text and dialogue about that text. \n\nWithin the wiki, use of a PageName creates a link to the named page\nin the usual way. But for page created with AutoWiki, the PageName link at the\ntop of the page takes you to the same-named link or node in the dialogue map.\n\nEach page would also have an assortment of finders'' tools accessible\nfrom it. These could include automatically generated pairs of links,\none to each node to which it is connected and one to the corresponding\npage; a pop-up index of all the pages on which that page/node name\noccurs; and a link to an automatically generated alphabetical list of\nall the pages and nodes in the system.\n\nI am not sure if documentation and evidence should be attached to the the map\nor the wiki page. I''m also not sure what you do with a page, or documentation\nattached to a page, if the node is deleted. Maybe a bin for deleted structures?\n\nAs someone who is not a professional programmer, I may be kidding myself about\nhow hard it would be to create such a system, but I do want to observe that\nwikis are generally open-source and that all wikis have easy standard features\nfor creating a page with a specified name and for automatically creating live\nlinks to that page wherever in the wiki the name is used. Most also have\nstructured discussion features such as those mentioned above as options. As a\nresult, i think it would be possible to add a lot of functionality to\nCompendium for a modest investment of effort. And of course you would not need\nevery thing i mentioned on the first pass. For example, some of the finders''\ntools could be\nadded later.\n\nOf all of the features embodied in this request, the ones that I think are most\ncritical to allowing the uses of Compendium to foster dialogs with distributed\nparticipants is the ability to give each node and link a unique, meaningful tag\n(â€œhandleâ€), ideally user-chosen, a convenient way to insert a link to\nanother website, and an easy way for distributed participants to learn the\nhandles and the associated url''s (perhaps by having a window from which it can\nbe copied pop up on hover) so that they can link to or from the node or line\nwith the specified handle. With these facilities and no more, a moderator could\nelaborate the dialogue map as it emerges from the discussion on a related site,\nand manual but easy and intuitive tools for linking back and fort from the map\nto discussions that take place on a related site (in any of a wide range of\nformats) could be constructed. \n\nIt would be even nicer if these tools could be automated, of course. And it\nwould be nice if several alternative visual and informational structures for\nthe related dialogue could be used â€“ threaded discussion, wiki, â€œyahoo\ngroupâ€-style forum, etc. â€“ though I think it is far more important to get\none up and working well than to get several that sort-of work most of the time. \n\nReturning to for a moment to the question of allowing distributed users to\nbuild a map, I have nothing to contribute on the technical side of this\ndiscussion, but I want to add a word or two from the perspective of a\nprospective user.\n\nThere are many, many cases where you want to bring a group of people together\nto engage in a discussion of make a decision where the commitment of the people\ninvolved is limited and the organizers do not have direct authority over the\nparticipants nor the resources to compensate (or threaten) them. This is the\n_typical_ situation in collaborative processes in the NGO setting, were I work,\nand a common one in academia, user groups, and many other settings. \n\nIn this setting it is essential that the cost of entry be low and the rewards\nimmediate. Organizers of this sort of process may have significant investment\nin making them go well, and can be asked to spend some time climbing the\nlearning curve. Also, once a participant has bought into a process and become\ninvested in its methods and outcome the participants are often willing to\ndevote genuine resources to making it work. But before such buy-in takes place,\neven quite minor barriers will cause potentially valuable participants to put\ntheir energy elsewhere.\n\nSomething I would put in the category, not of a minor barrier, but of a\nsignificant one, would be the requirement that participants install a piece of\nsoftware and learn how to use it. For most of the on-line dialogues I deal with\non a daily basis, this would be enough to guarantee that the process collapses\nbefore it gets properly started. I would therefore strongly urge that if there\nis any way to make the system work with a web-based interface, or some other\nsystem that uses software with which people believe themselves to be familiar,\neven at the cost of some functionality.\n\nIt is worth observing that people generally feel like they know what a browser\nis and what it does, even though they lack any technical understanding of the\nprocess. Moreover, I have observed that this familiarity can result in people\nfeeling like they are using software that they know how to use, even where the\nprocedure that they must use on a remote page is quite different from what they\nmost often do.

The most obvious of these is the top/left/right\nnavigation bars -- on a site with many pages, you wouldn''t want to\nhave to maintain these on every individual page if they basically are\nthe same across many pages.\n\nAlong with our (blessed) ability to have map backgrounds that can be\nany sort of graphic/layout, I think we need some kind of "include"\nability, similar to HTML includes, that can place not just single\nobjects (e.g. a graphic) but something like portions of other maps\nonto our maps.\n\nFor example, you could have a map that has a set of map nodes that\njust takes up the very top of a map (like the top navigation bar on a\nwebsite). I''d like the capability to "include"/transclude that map on\nthe top of another map.\n\nThat way you could just maintain the top navigation in one place in\nyour project, but have it update on all the other maps it''s\nincluded/transcluded in.\n\nObviously this is a big change to how we handle things today, but it\nwould be extremely useful not only for web publishing but also\nprojects like Co-OPR that have repeating navigation on many maps.\n\nFrom Maarten:\nMy only thought at the moment is to use something like templates in MediaWiki:\n\n"In MediaWiki, a template is a page which can be inserted into another page via\na process called transclusion. It is a wiki subroutine or iframe facility and\nis comparable to a #include statement or macro that is expanded at page view\ntime. Substitution allows templates to be used as a macro facility."\n\nMy response:\nI wonder if there is some way to do that within Compendium itself. Failing\nthat, we could at least (and more easily) do something on the HTML export\nlevel. We do have an enhancement on the list (for a long time) to allow custom\nHTML header and footer files to be added for web exports, this could be part of\nthat.

Somewhere in the menus (probably "Tools")\nthere''s an item that opens up a "search manager" or some such, in which I can\nspecify URLs and query string formats for interacting with various sites on the\nInternet. You might consider using one or more of the existing web standards\nfor defining search engine interactions, such as OpenSearch and/or Sherlock,\nand let me download pre-defined search plugins from the web.\nhttp://mycroft.mozdev.org/ claims to have over 23,000 search plugins for\nvarious browsers...it would be nice if Compendium could download and use these\nrather than requiring me to describe the search protocol myself. (Bonus points\nif Compendium automatically checks for updates to the plugins every so often!)\n\nAnyway, however the search plugins get created, once I have them registered\nwith Compendium, I''d like to be able to create Reference nodes that use them\ninstead of requiring me to input a URL. I think this could be done in the UI by\nmigrating the current Reference-specific fields into their own "Reference" tab\nalongside "Contents", "Properties" and "Views". In this tab, the first UI\nelement would be a drop-down box that lets me choose "URL" (in order to get the\ncurrent Reference behavior) or any of my currently registered search plugins.\nThe rest of the UI in this tab would change based on the variable fields\nspecific to my selected search plugin. So, for example, if Bugzilla search lets\nme specify (a) keywords (b) bug status (c) bug ID and (d) opened-by, all of\nthese would be text fields or drop-downs (as appropriate), created based on the\ndefinition of the search plugin. (Bonus points if the search plugin''s icon is\ndisplayed as the Reference node icon.)\n\nAlso, I think that if you reworked the Reference UI in this way, you could also\nextend this to handle internal reference nodes more elegantly: if I select\n"Internal" from the reference type drop-down, the UI could change to some kind\nof graphical selector that allows me to choose a node from one of my maps,\nright from the dialog box. This would be instead of that very cryptic comp://\nURL that you currently allow me to edit (but warn me not to touch in the help\nfiles).\n\nProbably also related to 974.\n\nComment 3 Ryan Saunders 2011-06-19 07:49:48 BST\n\nAlso, it would be super-cool if there were some really efficient way to create\nReference nodes using certain search engines. For example, if I have a search\nplugin that targets http://www.biblegateway.com, I''d like to be able to use a\nhot-key to insert a Reference using this plugin, and then just type the search\ntext as the node label (e.g., "John 3:16"), and have this the main search field\nauto-populated with this value, without me ever having to open up the contents\ndialog box.\n\nComment 4 Michelle Bachler 2011-06-20 12:19:15 BST\n\nI think this is a completely new feature request you have descibed here.

I change it back to straigt and change\nthichnes to 3 pt.\nResult: Link is straigt but 1 pt.\nIn the tool as well. I change thickness again to 3 pt and save again (Link and\nGroup of course).\nAnd: Link is still 3 pt (even when I draw a new one with this definition).\nLooking back in the Link-Group Tool: I see: 1 pt.\nErgo: Save doesnt work as expectet.\n\nComment 5 Michelle Bachler 2011-09-16 09:20:15 BST\n\nNow you say that I think there was a bug in Beta 1 with saving links which I\nhad forgotten until you mentioned it. I think have fixed it now for Beta 2. \n\nWORKAROUND: You can change the settings directly in the saved xml file if you\nare feeling adventurous. As you are unlikely to keep chaning it, it should not\nbe too onerous.\n\ngo to: <compendium dir>/Systems/resources/LinkGroups\nopen the xml file for your new linkgroup in a text editor.\n\nEach link is represented by a line in the file, which can be broken down as\nfollows:\n\n<linktype \nid="46" \nname="About" \ncolour="-16711681" \nlabel="" \narrowtype="1" \nlinkstyle="1" \nlinkdashed="0" \nlinkweight="1" \n/>\n\nid: leave the id number alone.\n\nname: the name as it appears in the link type lists.\n\ncolour: this would not be easy to add as these are generaled from java colours,\nso you could copy ones around from the default for now.\n\nlabel: any default text yopu want to automatically appear in the link when it\nis created.\n\narrowtypes options: \nNO_ARROW        = 0;\nARROW_TO        = 1;\nARROW_FROM        = 2;\nARROW_TO_AND_FROM    = 3;\n\nlinkstyle options:\n\nSTRAIGHT_LINK        = 0;\nCURVED_LINK        = 1;\nSQUARE_LINK        = 2;\n\nlinkdashed options:\n\nPLAIN_LINE        = 0;\nLARGE_DASHED_LINE    = 1;\nSMALL_DASHED_LINE    = 2;\n\nlinkweight: just a number count 1,2,3,4 etc representing thickness.\n\nHopefully this workaround will help until the beta 2 comes out.\n\nMichelle\n\n',0,'compendiumng')

It is not bad when you''re doing single tags here\nand there, but not so good when doing multiple tags in different combinations\nin rapid succession.\n\nCouple of things I thought of (besides the kb shortcuts in the works):\n\n- have a copy/paste special or similar action that would copy just the tags\nfrom one node and paste special them onto others (similar to Excel paste\nspecial formats or values)\n\n- have a "Tag Again" command (or Redo or similar action) that would apply the\nsame tag set as last done\n\nAlso I noticed that Alt-X didn''t work when more than one node was selected.\n\nAnother kind of problematic thing about the current UI is that (as Maarten has\npointed out) it takes too many clicks to assign multiple tags. A lot of times I\nleft out one of the many steps and ended up closing the dialog without having\nactually assigned any tags. Even with the kb shortcuts coming, we still need a\nbetter UI for ''power-tagging''... I don''t have any clear ideas although the\nabove may help. I''ll try to enlist my volunteer UI design corps to think about\nit.\n\nAl\n12/2005\n\nMay now be addressed by new Tags interface w/1.5.1 (AMS)\n(from old db, medium list)',0,'compendiumng')

Otherwise it would behave and\nhave the same properties as any other node type (Details, etc.)\n- Linking would work just like our other node types, except around the\nrectangle,.\n- Users could set the size of the rectangle, or it would grow as the size of\nthe label text\n\nThe below should be in Courier to see it correctly:\n\n------------------------------------\n| So the label of a Concept node |\n| would look something like this. |\n| It would wrap within the |\n| boundaries of the rectangle. |\n------------------------------------\n\nAl\n5/2004\n(from old db, medium list)\n\nComment 1 Michelle Bachler 2009-06-20 12:11:49 BST\n\nsee 226, 241\n\n',0,'compendiumng')

In this case, if it were switched on (via a checkbox in the Node\nProperties dialog), a rollover would perform an action like show a full-size\ngraphic, play a sound, even play a movie clip. It could even run a script that\nthe Ref node links to (e.g. a Javascript file).\n\nIn the short run, I''m most interested in the graphic and possibly sound\nrollover (so the scenario would be, rather than having to double-click on the\nRef node to launch a separate application to see the full-size graphic, it\nwould just display as an image within Compendium on rollover).\n\nThis would be terrific for educational uses of Compendium -- i.e. using\nCompendium to present a lecture, and as an off-line reference tool.\n\nIt would also pass this behavior on to exports (so for example an HTML page\nexported from Compendium would have the same rollover behavior on an image\nexported from a Reference node).\n\nThoughts?\n\nAl\n\n\nJust thinking about this some more... It would seem to make sense to me to \nhave the icon itself be the rollover point, since it is the image (or file. \netc.) that one would be interested in seeing fullsize. Remember that the \nrollover would have to be intentionally ''turned on'', it wouldn''t/shouldn''t \nbe the default behavior.\n\nAl\n\n\nIt''s a silly example, but what I have in mind should look/feel like the turtle\nimage on the right side of the page (down a bit) on\nhttp://www.wilsoninfo.com/rollgen1.html\n\n\n\n\n\n"M.S.Bachler" on 09/02/2003 11:54:20 AM\n\nTo: Al \ncc:\n\nSubject: RE: Double-click and triple-click in label\n\n\nAs a layer over the top of other nodes-links on the screen, like our other hint\nboxes for views and details?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSure, that makes sense.

The behavior I have in mind is just like a web page rollover --\nsomething appears as part of the existing view on rollover, not a separate\nwindow, etc.\n\nAl\n\n\nHi,\n\nIt''s not the effort that''s the issue so much as the flow in a presentation or\nnarrative mode. Double-clicking to launch a separate application (then having\nto close it again) can be disruptive, just as it would be if you had to do it\non a web page to see a rollover image. There are times when\ndouble-clicking/launching is desirable (the present state), but other times\nwhen a smooth flow is desirable and double-clicking/launching would disrupt\nthat flow.\n\nSo my idea is that double-clicking/launching is the default as at present, but\nrollover behavior is an option. I do like the idea of having a particular icon\nor area of the node to roll over to invoke the rollover behavior (to avoid the\nproblem of "unintentional rollover" that you point out). A little "R" perhaps.\nBut again, the idea is smooth flow, as opposed to having to click and launch.\n\nOne question is whether this is possible within Java as it is within web pages.\n\nAl\n\n\nHi there\n\nHmmm... not sure that roll-over is the best user interface device to use for\nthis: I would trigger events when I just want to move a node or edit the label.\nIs double-clicking such an overhead? It''s the normal way to launch events.\n\nI suppose one option is for a little icon to appear above the node (analogous\nto the T or * ) which analogously, when clicked launches the event, but surely\na double-click is not much more effort?\n\nsimon\n\n\n5/2003\n(from old db, medium list)',0,'compendiumng')

Bruce Kimball 2009-06-18 17:53:48 BST\n\nI have this need as well, and have been very successful as follows... Extract\nall text-only content of the attached documents and place it into page 2 and\nbeyond of the notes for the reference node. With a PDF, for example, you can\nusually select-all (if it is not just an image), copy and paste. A spreadsheet\ncan be exported as a csv. Similar tricks work with HTML and other document\ntypes. I prefer to do this on page 2 and beyond so that my "key word index"\ndoes not come up in the mouseovers, reserving page one of the notes for "real"\nnotes which I do wish to see on the mouseovers. I learned that search was not\nworking on page 2+ of the notes, but this has now been fixed (see bug #781).\nI''m not sure when we will have it in a downloadable release, but I am looking\nforward to this fix! My workaround in the meanwhile is to leave "real notes" at\nthe top of page one, and push all of the text for searching down on a sometimes\nvery long page one. You can also build a "key word or search-terms index" for\neach doc in the notes of course, which would also work if you need only a few\ncritical terms. I find it pretty effortless and useful just to throw in the\nentire content. Perhaps you would like to sneak this tip into the documentation\non searching, since I suspect this will be a common feature request (searching\non reference documents).\n\n',0,'compendiumng')

Save users ALOT of time. At present, you need FIVE\nclicks just to delete ONE extra instance. For each further instance, add 3-4\nmore. Eg. 3 nodes = about 13 clicks\n\n* PREVENT COMPENDIUM BECOMING OVERGROWN WITH INFO-WEEDS! Will prevent users''\n"info space" from becoming bogged down with the ''weeds'' of nodes they have not\nhad time to delete. For myself, this has been the main thing which has made me\nreluctantly have to abandon Compendium from time to time as an info- and task-\nmanagement system. With the pace of day-to-day use I  just don''t have time to\ndelete every instance of a node. (In my case, the same TASK in different\nCONTEXTS). So my maps end up littered with now-irrelevant nodes and before you\nknow it, Compendium is rendered too cluttered to be useful, without a\ntime-consuming clean-up.\nSo for me, this one simple command makes the difference between Compenndium\nbeing a lean, useable information powerhouse, or a highly-laudable white\nelephant lol (and I choose that metaphor carefully lol.) \n\n**Would be interested to hear other people''s experiences.**\n\n* A FASTER PROGRAM.

You could even zoom it inside\nCompendium before creating the jpg to create a smaller jpg image, though I\nsuspect that an actual image application may do a cleaner job of the scaling\nfor printing purposes.\n\nThere is no direct option to print the outline view itself, though you can\nexport maps to a Web Oultline view, which is basically a HTML page which\nfollows the same logic and presents a similar result. You can then import that\ninto Word, or print it through your browser. Read the help section on Web\nOutline Export and also note the formatting options it gives.\n\nYou can add email addresses into a reference node''s reference field and then\ndouble-clicking will launch your email app with that address in the ''To'' field.\nYou can''t currently drag and drop whole emails directly into Compendium. You\ncould just copy and paste their contents into a node''s details, or select and\ndrag text in the email. But the behaviour of that depends on the email\napplication and what exactly it supplies to Compendium on the drop.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nMichelle\n\nComment 2 clarke 2009-10-24 01:44:07 BST\n\non the email subject, most email apps have a way to referance an individual\nemail from an externally by a a link. notes uses a Doclink, Outlook supports \nhyperlinks for emails,tasks etc. being able to use these in a reference node\nwould be useful.\n\n',0,'compendiumng')

That sort of violates the per-map formatting\nwe have for other node characteristics.

Hence the image\nsize is held on a per node basis in the current release. \n\nIt would require changes to the database scheme to move the node image width\nand height from the ReferenceNode table to the ViewNode table and changes to\nthe core classes.\n\nNow that we have the node level presentation formatting I guess the image size\nshould be reconsidered to now be a formatting option on a per map basis as\nopposed to part of the image data on a per node basis as it was previously\nconsidered to be.\n\nI will reclassify this as a high priority feature request.\n\n',0,'compendiumng')

I thought I had make this configurable, and I was sort of right. I\nhad started anyway.\n\nIf you are using the Beta 1 version you may be able to change the location of\nthe Derby database in theory as the path to the database can be listed in the\nsystem.ini file (<compendium dir>/System/ini/system.ini).\n\nI want to stress at this point that I did not expose the property by adding it\nto the system.ini file yet, as I had not had time to test it before Beta 1\nneeded to go out and I was going to come back to it later.\n\nBut, in theory, if you added the property ''defaultDatabaseLocation=<your new\nlocation>'', to the system.ini file, it should be picked up by the code when it\nloads that file. I can see from the code that it is checking for it.\n\nIf I had added an entry for it, it would look like this:\n\ndefaultDatabaseLocation=System/resources/Databases\n\nBut the path should not need to be relative as long as you put the complete\npath. I have no idea about network drives, or encrypted etc. As I say, I have\nnot tested this at all. But if you really want to move the Derby Database it\nmight be worth having a go. \n\nI don''t think you can hurt anything by trying. Always backup the Databases\nfolder before you start of course. But, if it does not work, as long as you\nleave the current database where it is as well (or put it back again), and then\ntake the system.ini entry out of the file again afterwards, it will all just go\nback to normal and pick up the hardcoded efault path from the code.\n\nIf anyone tries it, let me know what happens! :-)\n\nComment 5 Sunnysekot 2011-09-16 16:34:27 BST\n\nHi Michelle, thanks for your efforts!\n\nI tried it, wrote it in the system.ini\ndefaultDatabaseLocation=O:/SICHERN/Databases\nand renamed my original database dir to another name\n\nresult:\nCompendium doesnt accept the new location and builds up a new Database Dir as\nif it was started the first time.\n\nSo that one didnt work for me, sorry.\n\nComment 6 Michelle Bachler 2011-09-19 09:51:15 BST\n\nOK, thanks for trying and letting me know.

What\nI suggested was that he utilize Compendium as a depository for thoughts and\nideas as they occur which will then enable him to align similar ideas about\nspecific topics and hopefully then be able to construct coherent responses. \n\nHe then asked an interesting question regarding the functionality of Compendium\nand whether it could automatically associate new inputs with existing ideas and\nthoughts. This would make association easier for him and those with similar\ndisabilities as recognizing connections is a significant element of his\nproblem.\n\nI''m not aware that this functionality exists within compendium and my question\nis simply could this function be developed?\n\nRegards\n\nComment 1 Michelle Bachler 2012-10-31 15:50:29 GMT\n\nCompendium has search to look for ideas with key words etc.\nYou can also turn on searching in node labels so as you type  a new node''s\nlabel it would bring up a list of other nodes with the same words you are\ntyping at the start of them. This is all that is currently there that is\nvaguely at least finding ideas.\n\nYou would need to explain more about how you imagine this automatic association\nworking. What is the association based on? Automatic association (linking\nidea), would need rules I assume on when and how those association would be\nmade.\n\n',0,'compendiumng')

Architecturally, we are unable to use either\nthe MySQL or Apache Derby databases and any database that we do use cannot be\ninstalled locally on a user machine.  Our development teams have looked at the\npossibility of modifying the code to support a SQL Server or Oracle DBMS and\nutilise a central database however their estimates of the effort involve\nindicate a significant cost to this.

The SQL looks fairly standard as well so Im almost tempted to give\nit a shot.  The only problem is the distinction between Derby and MySQL is made\nusing constants and methods with different names, spread across different\nclasses.  Adding versions for SQLServer is probably not the cleanest way to go\nabout this.  \n\nAnyway, if I do produce some working code I will post it here.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 3 Michelle Bachler 2010-02-16 11:56:34 GMT\n\nYes, sorry about that.\nAt some point I wanted to abstract it all more, so it was easier to add new\ndatabase types.

The default can be changed.\n* The list can added to by selection of a compendium element and copying its\nstyle to the list, the new style being nameable. (eg. select compendium item,\nclick a menu strip button or rt click and "add to style list")\n* The list can have items renamed and deleted.\n\nI suppose the compendium elements are: node, link and map(open).  Maybe each\nnode type could have its own style palette.\n\neg. for a link style, i should be able to set all the qualities for a link\n(including text), and save it to a name in the link style palette.

Unfortunately, it''s not easy to create space on the Compendium background\nfor new windows.  Windows can''t have their boundaries moved beyond the\nbackground boundary.  That means there''s a lot of window management activity in\nresponse to something conceptually simple.\n\nAlso, because mysql projects can be accessed across different pcs (with\ndifferent screen dimensions) then this means a map that opened ok on one\nscreen, may be too large for another screen - despite not being designed for\nthis eventuality.  This means some fiddly window management required to "pull\nin" the map boundary from beyond the edge of the background boundary.\n\nfeature request:\n================\nA solution to this could be to allow window to be designed to be moved such\nthat their boundaries go beyond the background boundary.  It would make moving\nwindows out of the way to find a previously covered and relevant map a simple\nact rather than a fiddly one.\n\nBut .. this could create an additional problem .. a map that has been moved\nnear to the edge of the background on one pc screen, could be beyond the edge\nand not at all visible on another pc with a smaller screen ..\n\nfeature request:\n================\n.. so, i suggest a window management menu option to "gather" all open maps to\nthe top left of the background. .. or .. \nfeature request:\n================\ncompendium, when opening a map, auto-detects its position relative to the\nbackground and moves it to top-left if it''s beyond the bounds of the\nbackground.\n\n-- i hope i haven''t explained myself in too confusing a manner.

But maybe I don''t have many\nWindows open at once.\n\nI tend to use the Window Menu where it lists the open Windows to jump between\nthem when I need to. I also use the Workspaces system to layout and remember\narrangements of maps I use a lot.The Window Menu also has the usual Cascade and\ntile options (which would recover Windows if they left the visible area). \n\nIn older versions of Compendium windows they could leave the visible area. But\nthen we had complaints about lost windows going off the edge and then I think I\nadded the constraint that the Windows had to stay. I started writting a scroll\nmechanism so Windows could go off, but you could scroll to them. I had issues\ngetting this working and it was buggy. So for a quick fix I just stopped\nWindows leaving the area. It is something I need to go back to.\n\nMichelle')

In order to participate in the\ntimeline view, the node would probably need to be manually dated, as the\nmodification date of the node is probably not meaningful in this context.\n\nHere''s an example of how I envision this working. Suppose I''m investigating the\nhistorical development of an idea (for example, the concept of a "canon of\nscripture" in Judaism and Christianity). In the course of my research, I\naccumulate various quotations from relevant ancient and modern writers and I\nstuff them into Reference nodes, which I tag with dates indicating my best\nguess of what year each quotation was written. These quotations are probably\nsupporting facts in the argument structure of one or more of my map views, but\nI also want to see how they relate to one another chronologically, so I\ncopy/paste them into a timeline view. Then, to provide additional context, I\ncreate additional nodes directly in the timeline view representing the dates of\nvarious events (e.g., the Council of Trent) and the lifespans of the relevant\nfigures (e.g., the life of Eusebius). In this way, I construct a visual\nchronology of the topic I''m investigating, with each node in the timeline being\nhyperlinked to references, related events and/or argumentation related to that\nevent.\n\nOne issue to keep in mind is that dates of ancient events are generally\nimprecise, and sometimes disputed. Thus, the date that a particular event\nhappened (e.g., the composition of the document known as "the Gospel according\nto Mark") could be the subject of one of the Questions under argumentation,\nwith different authors proposing different dates and arguing for their\nproposals, and the user might make a Decision regarding this issue. In my\nopinion, the timeline view should be able to indicate (a) spans of time (e.g.,\nby drawing the event as a rectangle rather than as a single point in time) as\nwell as (b) uncertainty/debate regarding a date/span (e.g., by drawing the\nuncertain time span as a fade-out from fully opaque to fully transparent.\n\nThe timeline view might be even more useful if, instead of having to manually\ncopy/paste nodes into the timeline view, I can instead link the timeline view\nto one or more map/list views, so that anything in one of those views with an\nassociated date is automatically plotted on the timeline. This would make it\nharder for things to get out-of-sync between my various views, since I only\nneed to worry about dating the various nodes, and not also copy/pasting them.\nOne additional enhancement could make it _impossible_ for things to get\nout-of-sync: if I could set a constraint on my map/list view that says\n"everything in here is required to have a date", then Compendium could help me\nby complaining "hey, you need to give this node a date!". Or, alternately,\nnodes in the linked views that don''t have dates could be drawn in a "date\nunknown" region of the timeline, which would be a way of visually notifying me\nthat I''d forgotten to date something.')

As you are unlikely to keep chaning it, it should not\nbe too onerous.\n\ngo to: <compendium dir>/Systems/resources/LinkGroups\nopen the xml file for your new linkgroup in a text editor.\n\nEach link is represented by a line in the file, which can be broken down as\nfollows:\n\n<linktype \nid="46" \nname="About" \ncolour="-16711681" \nlabel="" \narrowtype="1" \nlinkstyle="1" \nlinkdashed="0" \nlinkweight="1" \n/>\n\nid: leave the id number alone.\n\nname: the name as it appears in the link type lists.\n\ncolour: this would not be easy to add as these are generaled from java colours,\nso you could copy ones around from the default for now.\n\nlabel: any default text you want to automatically appear in the link when it\nis created.\n\narrowtypes options: \nNO_ARROW        = 0;\nARROW_TO        = 1;\nARROW_FROM        = 2;\nARROW_TO_AND_FROM    = 3;\n\nlinkstyle options:\n\nSTRAIGHT_LINK        = 0;\nCURVED_LINK        = 1;\nSQUARE_LINK        = 2;\n\nlinkdashed options:\n\nPLAIN_LINE        = 0;\nLARGE_DASHED_LINE    = 1;\nSMALL_DASHED_LINE    = 2;\n\nlinkweight: just a number count 1,2,3,4 etc representing thickness.\n\nHopefully this workaround will help until the beta 2 comes out.\n\nMichelle\n\nComment 4 Sunnysekot 2011-09-17 10:58:52 BST\n\nCreated an attachment (id=446) [details]\nmy link-group xml-file\n\nComment 5 Sunnysekot 2011-09-17 11:00:05 BST\n\nHi Michelle, thanks for your help!\n\nI tried out editing the xml and found a new problem (sorry!!!!!!)\n\n1. when I use german characters in labels ("gut für") the whole xml wont be\nread.

Somewhere in the menus (probably "Tools")\nthere''s an item that opens up a "search manager" or some such, in which I can\nspecify URLs and query string formats for interacting with various sites on the\nInternet. You might consider using one or more of the existing web standards\nfor defining search engine interactions, such as OpenSearch and/or Sherlock,\nand let me download pre-defined search plugins from the web.\nhttp://mycroft.mozdev.org/ claims to have over 23,000 search plugins for\nvarious browsers...it would be nice if Compendium could download and use these\nrather than requiring me to describe the search protocol myself. (Bonus points\nif Compendium automatically checks for updates to the plugins every so often!)\n\nAnyway, however the search plugins get created, once I have them registered\nwith Compendium, I''d like to be able to create Reference nodes that use them\ninstead of requiring me to input a URL. I think this could be done in the UI by\nmigrating the current Reference-specific fields into their own "Reference" tab\nalongside "Contents", "Properties" and "Views". In this tab, the first UI\nelement would be a drop-down box that lets me choose "URL" (in order to get the\ncurrent Reference behavior) or any of my currently registered search plugins.\nThe rest of the UI in this tab would change based on the variable fields\nspecific to my selected search plugin. So, for example, if Bugzilla search lets\nme specify (a) keywords (b) bug status (c) bug ID and (d) opened-by, all of\nthese would be text fields or drop-downs (as appropriate), created based on the\ndefinition of the search plugin. (Bonus points if the search plugin''s icon is\ndisplayed as the Reference node icon.)\n\nAlso, I think that if you reworked the Reference UI in this way, you could also\nextend this to handle internal reference nodes more elegantly: if I select\n"Internal" from the reference type drop-down, the UI could change to some kind\nof graphical selector that allows me to choose a node from one of my maps,\nright from the dialog box. This would be instead of that very cryptic comp://\nURL that you currently allow me to edit (but warn me not to touch in the help\nfiles).\n\nProbably also related to 974.\n\nAlso, it would be super-cool if there were some really efficient way to create\nReference nodes using certain search engines. For example, if I have a search\nplugin that targets http://www.biblegateway.com, I''d like to be able to use a\nhot-key to insert a Reference using this plugin, and then just type the search\ntext as the node label (e.g., "John 3:16"), and have the primary search field\nauto-populated with this value, without me ever having to open up the contents\ndialog box.')

In that spirit, I think I will lay out the\nfull cluster of features I would like to have ideally.\n\nI have been corresponding with a number of people, here and elsewhere,\nabout our mutual desire to be able to build a dialogue map collectively (but\nperhaps asynchronously) in a manner analogous to the construction of the\nWikipedia. I know that there are people here working on, or at least thinking\nof working on, this goal. \n\nTo a version of Compendium that supports dialogue maps created in this fashion,\nI would like to add an "AutoWiki" feature. It would look something like this:\n\nWe start with a map that is editable by any group member (with good \n"restore" and history functions!!). When the AutoWiki feature is\nturned on, we require that as the map is constructed, each node and\nline be named meaningfully, using the common wiki "CamelCase" naming\nconvention. You would need a special procedure to add such names if\nyou turn it on for an existing map without them. The meaningful names\nwould be used in addition to or in place of the existing automatically\ngenerated tags for linking purposes.\n\nAutoWiki will then automatically create a reciprocally connected wiki\npage of the same name, with the usual assortment of wiki features and tools for\nboth common text and dialogue about that text. \n\nWithin the wiki, use of a PageName creates a link to the named page\nin the usual way. But for page created with AutoWiki, the PageName link at the\ntop of the page takes you to the same-named link or node in the dialogue map.\n\nEach page would also have an assortment of finders'' tools accessible\nfrom it. These could include automatically generated pairs of links,\none to each node to which it is connected and one to the corresponding\npage; a pop-up index of all the pages on which that page/node name\noccurs; and a link to an automatically generated alphabetical list of\nall the pages and nodes in the system.\n\nI am not sure if documentation and evidence should be attached to the the map\nor the wiki page. I''m also not sure what you do with a page, or documentation\nattached to a page, if the node is deleted. Maybe a bin for deleted structures?\n\nAs someone who is not a professional programmer, I may be kidding myself about\nhow hard it would be to create such a system, but I do want to observe that\nwikis are generally open-source and that all wikis have easy standard features\nfor creating a page with a specified name and for automatically creating live\nlinks to that page wherever in the wiki the name is used. Most also have\nstructured discussion features such as those mentioned above as options. As a\nresult, i think it would be possible to add a lot of functionality to\nCompendium for a modest investment of effort. And of course you would not need\nevery thing i mentioned on the first pass. For example, some of the finders''\ntools could be\nadded later.\n\nOf all of the features embodied in this request, the ones that I think are most\ncritical to allowing the uses of Compendium to foster dialogs with distributed\nparticipants is the ability to give each node and link a unique, meaningful tag\n(â€œhandleâ€), ideally user-chosen, a convenient way to insert a link to\nanother website, and an easy way for distributed participants to learn the\nhandles and the associated url''s (perhaps by having a window from which it can\nbe copied pop up on hover) so that they can link to or from the node or line\nwith the specified handle. With these facilities and no more, a moderator could\nelaborate the dialogue map as it emerges from the discussion on a related site,\nand manual but easy and intuitive tools for linking back and fort from the map\nto discussions that take place on a related site (in any of a wide range of\nformats) could be constructed. \n\nIt would be even nicer if these tools could be automated, of course. And it\nwould be nice if several alternative visual and informational structures for\nthe related dialogue could be used â€“ threaded discussion, wiki, â€œyahoo\ngroupâ€-style forum, etc. â€“ though I think it is far more important to get\none up and working well than to get several that sort-of work most of the time. \n\nReturning to for a moment to the question of allowing distributed users to\nbuild a map, I have nothing to contribute on the technical side of this\ndiscussion, but I want to add a word or two from the perspective of a\nprospective user.\n\nThere are many, many cases where you want to bring a group of people together\nto engage in a discussion of make a decision where the commitment of the people\ninvolved is limited and the organizers do not have direct authority over the\nparticipants nor the resources to compensate (or threaten) them. This is the\n_typical_ situation in collaborative processes in the NGO setting, were I work,\nand a common one in academia, user groups, and many other settings. \n\nIn this setting it is essential that the cost of entry be low and the rewards\nimmediate. Organizers of this sort of process may have significant investment\nin making them go well, and can be asked to spend some time climbing the\nlearning curve. Also, once a participant has bought into a process and become\ninvested in its methods and outcome the participants are often willing to\ndevote genuine resources to making it work. But before such buy-in takes place,\neven quite minor barriers will cause potentially valuable participants to put\ntheir energy elsewhere.\n\nSomething I would put in the category, not of a minor barrier, but of a\nsignificant one, would be the requirement that participants install a piece of\nsoftware and learn how to use it. For most of the on-line dialogues I deal with\non a daily basis, this would be enough to guarantee that the process collapses\nbefore it gets properly started. I would therefore strongly urge that if there\nis any way to make the system work with a web-based interface, or some other\nsystem that uses software with which people believe themselves to be familiar,\neven at the cost of some functionality.\n\nIt is worth observing that people generally feel like they know what a browser\nis and what it does, even though they lack any technical understanding of the\nprocess. Moreover, I have observed that this familiarity can result in people\nfeeling like they are using software that they know how to use, even where the\nprocedure that they must use on a remote page is quite different from what they\nmost often do. This is especially true where the actions can be identified with\ncommon actions that people take on web pages, such as making a choice by\npoint-and-click, filling out a form, etc. Remember that most people know how to\nuse yahoo groups and the like, a few with using wikis, and not many with any\ngraphical representation system.\n\nAndrew Hoerner\nhoerner@redefiningprogress.org\n\nComment 1 Michelle Bachler 2006-11-27 11:48:37 GMT\n\n*** Bug 244 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***\n\nComment 2 Eugene Eric Kim 2007-01-25 19:58:28 GMT\n\nI agree that there''s great potential in having distributed, multiuser maps,\nalthough I have doubts about using existing Web-based tools to create these\nmaps.\n\nThat said, I''d like to point out that the functionality described here is\npossible without any modifications to the core Compendium code.

The most obvious of these is the top/left/right\nnavigation bars -- on a site with many pages, you wouldn''t want to\nhave to maintain these on every individual page if they basically are\nthe same across many pages.\n\nAlong with our (blessed) ability to have map backgrounds that can be\nany sort of graphic/layout, I think we need some kind of "include"\nability, similar to HTML includes, that can place not just single\nobjects (e.g. a graphic) but something like portions of other maps\nonto our maps.\n\nFor example, you could have a map that has a set of map nodes that\njust takes up the very top of a map (like the top navigation bar on a\nwebsite). I''d like the capability to "include"/transclude that map on\nthe top of another map.\n\nThat way you could just maintain the top navigation in one place in\nyour project, but have it update on all the other maps it''s\nincluded/transcluded in.\n\nObviously this is a big change to how we handle things today, but it\nwould be extremely useful not only for web publishing but also\nprojects like Co-OPR that have repeating navigation on many maps.\n\nFrom Maarten:\nMy only thought at the moment is to use something like templates in MediaWiki:\n\n"In MediaWiki, a template is a page which can be inserted into another page via\na process called transclusion. It is a wiki subroutine or iframe facility and\nis comparable to a #include statement or macro that is expanded at page view\ntime. Substitution allows templates to be used as a macro facility."\n\nMy response:\nI wonder if there is some way to do that within Compendium itself. Failing\nthat, we could at least (and more easily) do something on the HTML export\nlevel. We do have an enhancement on the list (for a long time) to allow custom\nHTML header and footer files to be added for web exports, this could be part of\nthat. But it would be better if it could be done working within Compendium, not\nrequiring HTML coding knowledge.')

The\nTOC was done as a quick summer student project in 2001 and was never intended\nto be the permanent way.\n\n2) When you export without the TOC etc., have an option to have a friendlier\nURL for the top page (the map you exported from) than the default map title +\nIP address + time (e.g. "Publications_19216811011164221841074.html". I know the\nlong URL is necessary for uniquely identifying the map in the case that there\nare multiple maps with the same names, but what I''m proposing is that the\nfriendly URL be in addition to the verbose one. What could happen is that, if\nyou select that option, you create an HTML redirect that redirects the friendly\nURL to the verbose one.\n\nFor example: Your friendly URL would be "Publications.html"; the export would\ngenerate a web page with a simple redirect on it (and maybe the customary "this\npage should redirect, if not here''s the direct link to the new page) to\n"Publications_19216811011164221841074.html".\n\nThis would remove the need to have to create tinyURLs.')

Somewhere in the menus (probably "Tools")\nthere''s an item that opens up a "search manager" or some such, in which I can\nspecify URLs and query string formats for interacting with various sites on the\nInternet. You might consider using one or more of the existing web standards\nfor defining search engine interactions, such as OpenSearch and/or Sherlock,\nand let me download pre-defined search plugins from the web.\nhttp://mycroft.mozdev.org/ claims to have over 23,000 search plugins for\nvarious browsers...it would be nice if Compendium could download and use these\nrather than requiring me to describe the search protocol myself. (Bonus points\nif Compendium automatically checks for updates to the plugins every so often!)\n\nAnyway, however the search plugins get created, once I have them registered\nwith Compendium, I''d like to be able to create Reference nodes that use them\ninstead of requiring me to input a URL. I think this could be done in the UI by\nmigrating the current Reference-specific fields into their own "Reference" tab\nalongside "Contents", "Properties" and "Views". In this tab, the first UI\nelement would be a drop-down box that lets me choose "URL" (in order to get the\ncurrent Reference behavior) or any of my currently registered search plugins.\nThe rest of the UI in this tab would change based on the variable fields\nspecific to my selected search plugin. So, for example, if Bugzilla search lets\nme specify (a) keywords (b) bug status (c) bug ID and (d) opened-by, all of\nthese would be text fields or drop-downs (as appropriate), created based on the\ndefinition of the search plugin. (Bonus points if the search plugin''s icon is\ndisplayed as the Reference node icon.)\n\nAlso, I think that if you reworked the Reference UI in this way, you could also\nextend this to handle internal reference nodes more elegantly: if I select\n"Internal" from the reference type drop-down, the UI could change to some kind\nof graphical selector that allows me to choose a node from one of my maps,\nright from the dialog box. This would be instead of that very cryptic comp://\nURL that you currently allow me to edit (but warn me not to touch in the help\nfiles).\n\nProbably also related to 974.\n\nComment 3 Ryan Saunders 2011-06-19 07:49:48 BST\n\nAlso, it would be super-cool if there were some really efficient way to create\nReference nodes using certain search engines. For example, if I have a search\nplugin that targets http://www.biblegateway.com, I''d like to be able to use a\nhot-key to insert a Reference using this plugin, and then just type the search\ntext as the node label (e.g., "John 3:16"), and have this the main search field\nauto-populated with this value, without me ever having to open up the contents\ndialog box.\n\nComment 4 Michelle Bachler 2011-06-20 12:19:15 BST\n\nI think this is a completely new feature request you have descibed here. This\nitem is only talking about Compendium''s internal search interface, adding\nnetwork search and such. \n\nCan you please create a new item for what you have described.\n\nThanks\n\nMichelle\n\nComment 5 Ryan Saunders 2011-06-24 08:44:50 BST\n\nDone, as issue 1002.\n\n')

Added a few. My problem: I change line to straigt\nand save it. Seems to work. I try the new link: Its curved!\nIs open the Link Tool: Yes, its curved. I change it back to straigt and change\nthichnes to 3 pt.\nResult: Link is straigt but 1 pt.\nIn the tool as well. I change thickness again to 3 pt and save again (Link and\nGroup of course).\nAnd: Link is still 3 pt (even when I draw a new one with this definition).\nLooking back in the Link-Group Tool: I see: 1 pt.\nErgo: Save doesnt work as expectet.\n\nComment 5 Michelle Bachler 2011-09-16 09:20:15 BST\n\nNow you say that I think there was a bug in Beta 1 with saving links which I\nhad forgotten until you mentioned it. I think have fixed it now for Beta 2. \n\nWORKAROUND: You can change the settings directly in the saved xml file if you\nare feeling adventurous. As you are unlikely to keep chaning it, it should not\nbe too onerous.\n\ngo to: <compendium dir>/Systems/resources/LinkGroups\nopen the xml file for your new linkgroup in a text editor.\n\nEach link is represented by a line in the file, which can be broken down as\nfollows:\n\n<linktype \nid="46" \nname="About" \ncolour="-16711681" \nlabel="" \narrowtype="1" \nlinkstyle="1" \nlinkdashed="0" \nlinkweight="1" \n/>\n\nid: leave the id number alone.\n\nname: the name as it appears in the link type lists.\n\ncolour: this would not be easy to add as these are generaled from java colours,\nso you could copy ones around from the default for now.\n\nlabel: any default text yopu want to automatically appear in the link when it\nis created.\n\narrowtypes options: \nNO_ARROW        = 0;\nARROW_TO        = 1;\nARROW_FROM        = 2;\nARROW_TO_AND_FROM    = 3;\n\nlinkstyle options:\n\nSTRAIGHT_LINK        = 0;\nCURVED_LINK        = 1;\nSQUARE_LINK        = 2;\n\nlinkdashed options:\n\nPLAIN_LINE        = 0;\nLARGE_DASHED_LINE    = 1;\nSMALL_DASHED_LINE    = 2;\n\nlinkweight: just a number count 1,2,3,4 etc representing thickness.\n\nHopefully this workaround will help until the beta 2 comes out.\n\nMichelle\n\n')

It is not bad when you''re doing single tags here\nand there, but not so good when doing multiple tags in different combinations\nin rapid succession.\n\nCouple of things I thought of (besides the kb shortcuts in the works):\n\n- have a copy/paste special or similar action that would copy just the tags\nfrom one node and paste special them onto others (similar to Excel paste\nspecial formats or values)\n\n- have a "Tag Again" command (or Redo or similar action) that would apply the\nsame tag set as last done\n\nAlso I noticed that Alt-X didn''t work when more than one node was selected.\n\nAnother kind of problematic thing about the current UI is that (as Maarten has\npointed out) it takes too many clicks to assign multiple tags. A lot of times I\nleft out one of the many steps and ended up closing the dialog without having\nactually assigned any tags. Even with the kb shortcuts coming, we still need a\nbetter UI for ''power-tagging''... I don''t have any clear ideas although the\nabove may help.

Remember that the \nrollover would have to be intentionally ''turned on'', it wouldn''t/shouldn''t \nbe the default behavior.\n\nAl\n\n\nIt''s a silly example, but what I have in mind should look/feel like the turtle\nimage on the right side of the page (down a bit) on\nhttp://www.wilsoninfo.com/rollgen1.html\n\n\n\n\n\n"M.S.Bachler" on 09/02/2003 11:54:20 AM\n\nTo: Al \ncc:\n\nSubject: RE: Double-click and triple-click in label\n\n\nAs a layer over the top of other nodes-links on the screen, like our other hint\nboxes for views and details?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSure, that makes sense.

The behavior I have in mind is just like a web page rollover --\nsomething appears as part of the existing view on rollover, not a separate\nwindow, etc.\n\nAl\n\n\nHi,\n\nIt''s not the effort that''s the issue so much as the flow in a presentation or\nnarrative mode. Double-clicking to launch a separate application (then having\nto close it again) can be disruptive, just as it would be if you had to do it\non a web page to see a rollover image. There are times when\ndouble-clicking/launching is desirable (the present state), but other times\nwhen a smooth flow is desirable and double-clicking/launching would disrupt\nthat flow.\n\nSo my idea is that double-clicking/launching is the default as at present, but\nrollover behavior is an option. I do like the idea of having a particular icon\nor area of the node to roll over to invoke the rollover behavior (to avoid the\nproblem of "unintentional rollover" that you point out). A little "R" perhaps.\nBut again, the idea is smooth flow, as opposed to having to click and launch.\n\nOne question is whether this is possible within Java as it is within web pages.\n\nAl\n\n\nHi there\n\nHmmm... not sure that roll-over is the best user interface device to use for\nthis: I would trigger events when I just want to move a node or edit the label.\nIs double-clicking such an overhead? It''s the normal way to launch events.\n\nI suppose one option is for a little icon to appear above the node (analogous\nto the T or * ) which analogously, when clicked launches the event, but surely\na double-click is not much more effort?\n\nsimon\n\n\n5/2003\n(from old db, medium list)')

Bruce Kimball 2009-06-18 17:53:48 BST\n\nI have this need as well, and have been very successful as follows... Extract\nall text-only content of the attached documents and place it into page 2 and\nbeyond of the notes for the reference node. With a PDF, for example, you can\nusually select-all (if it is not just an image), copy and paste. A spreadsheet\ncan be exported as a csv. Similar tricks work with HTML and other document\ntypes. I prefer to do this on page 2 and beyond so that my "key word index"\ndoes not come up in the mouseovers, reserving page one of the notes for "real"\nnotes which I do wish to see on the mouseovers. I learned that search was not\nworking on page 2+ of the notes, but this has now been fixed (see bug #781).\nI''m not sure when we will have it in a downloadable release, but I am looking\nforward to this fix! My workaround in the meanwhile is to leave "real notes" at\nthe top of page one, and push all of the text for searching down on a sometimes\nvery long page one. You can also build a "key word or search-terms index" for\neach doc in the notes of course, which would also work if you need only a few\ncritical terms. I find it pretty effortless and useful just to throw in the\nentire content. Perhaps you would like to sneak this tip into the documentation\non searching, since I suspect this will be a common feature request (searching\non reference documents).\n\n')

Why?\n1. You will only use this feature if you REALLY DO want to get rid of it from\nall views.\n2. If you want to see the views it''s in, just click on it and look at views in\nthe CONTENTS menu.\nLet''s not make it unecessarily complicated.\nA simple context menu (and main menu) and a confirmation dialogue box will do!\nThose other functions mentioned by the other could later be put into some sort\nof "manage node" tab in the CONTENTS box. \nIn fact, that could be a way of achieving fine distinctions in this whole\n"delete issue"! In the view menu, have a delete button.\n\nComment 4 Sean 2006-10-14 02:49:04 BST\n\nTo clarify, my suggestion would be:\n\n1. Include the command\n"DELETE FROM ALL VIEWS"\nin\n- the right-click context menu for nodes\n- the EDIT menu at the top\n\n2. In the VIEW tab that currently every node has, have a DELETE button that\nallows you to delete a node from several different views in one go.\n\nLOVE this program!\n\nComment 5 Sean 2008-05-19 02:20:58 BST\n\nThis function, ("delete all instances"?) will:\n\n* SAVE HUNDREDS OF CLICKS. Save users ALOT of time. At present, you need FIVE\nclicks just to delete ONE extra instance. For each further instance, add 3-4\nmore. Eg. 3 nodes = about 13 clicks\n\n* PREVENT COMPENDIUM BECOMING OVERGROWN WITH INFO-WEEDS! Will prevent users''\n"info space" from becoming bogged down with the ''weeds'' of nodes they have not\nhad time to delete. For myself, this has been the main thing which has made me\nreluctantly have to abandon Compendium from time to time as an info- and task-\nmanagement system. With the pace of day-to-day use I  just don''t have time to\ndelete every instance of a node. (In my case, the same TASK in different\nCONTEXTS). So my maps end up littered with now-irrelevant nodes and before you\nknow it, Compendium is rendered too cluttered to be useful, without a\ntime-consuming clean-up.\nSo for me, this one simple command makes the difference between Compenndium\nbeing a lean, useable information powerhouse, or a highly-laudable white\nelephant lol (and I choose that metaphor carefully lol.) \n\n**Would be interested to hear other people''s experiences.**\n\n* A FASTER PROGRAM. Presumably this would contribute to speeding the program\nup, because there would be fewer total nodes to keep track of.\n\nComment 6 Michelle Bachler 2009-06-20 11:51:55 BST\n\n*** Bug 302 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***\n\nComment 7 Al Selvin 2011-04-28 14:31:12 BST\n\n*** Issue 992 has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***\n\n')

Thanks for\nthat!\n\nBut I have a few problems that you may want to look at: \n- printing a map gives no option of reducing to fit one page of paper\n- I cannot find an option to print the outline view.\n\n\nIn an introduction I think that I heard that you can also add e-mails to the\nmap. I dont find that option and have tried to drag mails onto the page without\nsuccess.\n\nThure\n\nComment 1 Michelle Bachler 2006-11-30 11:30:11 GMT\n\nNo, currently there is no option to reduce to fit to paper when printing.\nHowever, you could Export a map to jpg (File Menu / Export / JPG File), then\nput the jpg image in another app to print it which did have fit to page (say\nWord or an actual image processing app). You could even zoom it inside\nCompendium before creating the jpg to create a smaller jpg image, though I\nsuspect that an actual image application may do a cleaner job of the scaling\nfor printing purposes.\n\nThere is no direct option to print the outline view itself, though you can\nexport maps to a Web Oultline view, which is basically a HTML page which\nfollows the same logic and presents a similar result. You can then import that\ninto Word, or print it through your browser. Read the help section on Web\nOutline Export and also note the formatting options it gives.\n\nYou can add email addresses into a reference node''s reference field and then\ndouble-clicking will launch your email app with that address in the ''To'' field.\nYou can''t currently drag and drop whole emails directly into Compendium. You\ncould just copy and paste their contents into a node''s details, or select and\ndrag text in the email. But the behaviour of that depends on the email\napplication and what exactly it supplies to Compendium on the drop.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nMichelle\n\nComment 2 clarke 2009-10-24 01:44:07 BST\n\non the email subject, most email apps have a way to referance an individual\nemail from an externally by a a link. notes uses a Doclink, Outlook supports \nhyperlinks for emails,tasks etc. being able to use these in a reference node\nwould be useful.\n\n')

I thought I had make this configurable, and I was sort of right. I\nhad started anyway.\n\nIf you are using the Beta 1 version you may be able to change the location of\nthe Derby database in theory as the path to the database can be listed in the\nsystem.ini file (<compendium dir>/System/ini/system.ini).\n\nI want to stress at this point that I did not expose the property by adding it\nto the system.ini file yet, as I had not had time to test it before Beta 1\nneeded to go out and I was going to come back to it later.\n\nBut, in theory, if you added the property ''defaultDatabaseLocation=<your new\nlocation>'', to the system.ini file, it should be picked up by the code when it\nloads that file. I can see from the code that it is checking for it.\n\nIf I had added an entry for it, it would look like this:\n\ndefaultDatabaseLocation=System/resources/Databases\n\nBut the path should not need to be relative as long as you put the complete\npath. I have no idea about network drives, or encrypted etc. As I say, I have\nnot tested this at all. But if you really want to move the Derby Database it\nmight be worth having a go. \n\nI don''t think you can hurt anything by trying. Always backup the Databases\nfolder before you start of course. But, if it does not work, as long as you\nleave the current database where it is as well (or put it back again), and then\ntake the system.ini entry out of the file again afterwards, it will all just go\nback to normal and pick up the hardcoded efault path from the code.\n\nIf anyone tries it, let me know what happens! :-)\n\nComment 5 Sunnysekot 2011-09-16 16:34:27 BST\n\nHi Michelle, thanks for your efforts!\n\nI tried it, wrote it in the system.ini\ndefaultDatabaseLocation=O:/SICHERN/Databases\nand renamed my original database dir to another name\n\nresult:\nCompendium doesnt accept the new location and builds up a new Database Dir as\nif it was started the first time.\n\nSo that one didnt work for me, sorry.\n\nComment 6 Michelle Bachler 2011-09-19 09:51:15 BST\n\nOK, thanks for trying and letting me know.

This is not intuitive based on the button''s\nlabel and it is dangerous due to the fact that it will insert any selected\nnodes into the map if not already their.\n\nI recommend removing the "Show in map" feature from the "Insert into View"\nbutton and create a new button that will open all maps containing the\nhighlighted node''s in the list and highlight the associated nodes in the maps. \nThis would address the scenario where the user accesses the Tag tree to see\nwhat nodes match a set of tags and then wants to quickly access one or more of\nthem in the map view to work with them or just better understand the context in\nwhich they are being used.  This will allow the user to then get even a further\nperspective on the nodes by switching to the Outline View which will also be\nshowing the highlighted nodes.\n\nComment 1 Michelle Bachler 2007-01-22 11:22:41 GMT\n\nUsually in all other areas in compedium which have an ''Insert into View''\noption, they always highlight the nodes inserted so you can spot where they are\n(especially if they where already there and hence not really added again).\nUnfortunaley due to the nature of the Tags working area (read entry 427 for\ndetails), this could not be done in the same way here, so I at least indicate\nthem with the rollover borders for some level of consitancy with the rest of\nCompendium, and this will not change.\n\nFor each node you can rollover the Parent View number in the table to quickly\ndisplay a list of views it is in for context and you can open any view that the\nnode is in from this list. However, if you do open a view this way, the node\nwill be highlighted and hence the tags working area list will change to be that\nhightlighted node.\n\nI have reclassified this item as a feature request for the idea of the ''Show in\nMap'' feature you have described to be considered by the team and the community\nfor implementation in a future release.\n\n')

I have a user who frequently looses nodes she\nhas just typed because she gets moving fast, makes a mistake, tries to delete\ntext, and ends up deleting the node somehow.\n\nComment 1 Michelle Bachler 2007-03-15 09:26:30 GMT\n\nThe backspace IS an alternative to the delete key for deleting nodes. I believe\nthis was added for Mac users (Al, Simon.. correct me if I am wrong), but as far\nas I recall, the Mac uses the backspace key to delete files and other objects\netc as standard, not the delete key. Hence we support both keys for deleting a\nnode. \n\nI am not sure how your firend is getting into this situation. Possibly she is\npressing the esc key while typing in a node label, which would move the focus\nback to the node proper. A subsequent backspace would delete the node.\n\nThis not really a bug. It was a design decision to support the backspace. I\nthink on the Mac it is usually the Apple key + backspace to delete files, so\nmaybe we could look at that. Also we could change the programming from a\ngeneral support to only supporting the backspace when Compendium is running on\nthe Mac (not something I really like to do though - platform specific\nprogramming).\n\nI will change this to a feature request and will look into it at some point.\n\n')

I think it might be useful to introduce some short cuts and mouse\nfeatures to the navigation. Once you have a project with a large number of\nnodes, zooming in and out becomes a little tiresome. As with web browsers,\ncould a short cut of "ctrl + [scroll up or down on mouse wheel]" be introduced\nas a short cut for zooming in and out.\n\nFor navigation within each zoom level, it would be useful to be able to "grab"\nand shift view as in many graphical editing programs. I know the left button is\nreserved, but the right only comes into play when establishing links between\nnodes. Its secondary function could be to shift views through a click and drag.\n\nCheers\nGareth\n\nComment 1 Michelle Bachler 2010-04-14 11:58:55 BST\n\nShortcuts for zooming are: \n\nZoom, in repeated steps.         F2\nZoom the view to Fit the screen. F3\nZoom, to Focus on this node.     F4\n\nTo move map around use right-click drag on white space of map.\n\nSee Compendium Help Menu/Help Contents/Keyboard Shortcuts for full list of\nshortcuts.\n\nMichelle\n\nComment 2 WBT 2011-10-24 21:14:23 BST\n\nIt''s nice to hear that there is a mouse panning option.  I agree with Gareth\nthat scroll wheel zoom would be a very nice feature, increasing usability. \nLeft-click pan might too, but then you''d need to consider how it affects other\ngestures. \nThanks for your work on this!\n\n')

What\nI suggested was that he utilize Compendium as a depository for thoughts and\nideas as they occur which will then enable him to align similar ideas about\nspecific topics and hopefully then be able to construct coherent responses. \n\nHe then asked an interesting question regarding the functionality of Compendium\nand whether it could automatically associate new inputs with existing ideas and\nthoughts. This would make association easier for him and those with similar\ndisabilities as recognizing connections is a significant element of his\nproblem.\n\nI''m not aware that this functionality exists within compendium and my question\nis simply could this function be developed?\n\nRegards\n\nComment 1 Michelle Bachler 2012-10-31 15:50:29 GMT\n\nCompendium has search to look for ideas with key words etc.\nYou can also turn on searching in node labels so as you type  a new node''s\nlabel it would bring up a list of other nodes with the same words you are\ntyping at the start of them. This is all that is currently there that is\nvaguely at least finding ideas.\n\nYou would need to explain more about how you imagine this automatic association\nworking. What is the association based on? Automatic association (linking\nidea), would need rules I assume on when and how those association would be\nmade.\n\n')
