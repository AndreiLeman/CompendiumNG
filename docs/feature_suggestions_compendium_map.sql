Architecturally, we are unable to use either\nthe MySQL or Apache Derby databases and any database that we do use cannot be\ninstalled locally on a user machine.  Our development teams have looked at the\npossibility of modifying the code to support a SQL Server or Oracle DBMS and\nutilise a central database however their estimates of the effort involve\nindicate a significant cost to this.  I was wondering if any other companies\nmay have undertaken this work already and submitted it back to yourselves for\ndistribution or whether this is something the compendium team are working on\nfor a future release.\n\nMany thanks,\nTrevor Davies\nTechnical Architect\nBritish Energy\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 1 Michelle Bachler 2007-06-13 12:50:11 BST\n\nNo, unfortunately not and we have no plans at present to extend the system to\nsupport further databases. You can submit a feature request for this, and it\nwill be considered along with all others, but it is unlikely to become a\npriority for us at present. This is the sort of area that we hoped external\ndevelopers would contribute in though.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 2 Dirk Gorissen 2010-02-16 08:46:38 GMT\n\nIts been more than two years since this post but it is an issue I am also\ninterested in.  From the mailinglist I understood that still no work has been\ndone in this direction.\n\nI loaded the code into eclipse and it all looks quite clean and well\nstructured.  The SQL looks fairly standard as well so Im almost tempted to give\nit a shot.  The only problem is the distinction between Derby and MySQL is made\nusing constants and methods with different names, spread across different\nclasses.  Adding versions for SQLServer is probably not the cleanest way to go\nabout this.  \n\nAnyway, if I do produce some working code I will post it here.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 3 Michelle Bachler 2010-02-16 11:56:34 GMT\n\nYes, sorry about that.\nAt some point I wanted to abstract it all more, so it was easier to add new\ndatabase types.

It''s certainly not an absent\nminded momentary triviality to create a consistent style (which deviates\nsignificantly from the default) within a map or between maps (for nodes, links,\nbackgrounds, text, etc.)\n\nI think the qualitative experience of using Compendium could be improved hugely\nmerely by improving the fluency of style management.\n\ni suggest using style palettes. \n\nBy "palette" i mean, for each compendium element that can have style: a list of\nstyles available for selection. \n* Each compendium element will have its own style list.\n* The style list will have a default where a new compendium elements is created\nwith the default style. The default can be changed.\n* The list can added to by selection of a compendium element and copying its\nstyle to the list, the new style being nameable. (eg. select compendium item,\nclick a menu strip button or rt click and "add to style list")\n* The list can have items renamed and deleted.\n\nI suppose the compendium elements are: node, link and map(open).  Maybe each\nnode type could have its own style palette.\n\neg. for a link style, i should be able to set all the qualities for a link\n(including text), and save it to a name in the link style palette.  I should\nalso be able to select one or a number of links and click a "style button" to\napply that style onto the element(s).\n\nsimilarly for nodes and maps.\n\n... just to go further out on the limb ...\nrather than have the style palette defaults be global, it might be useful to\nhave:\neach map have its own set of element style defaults (to make it easier for each\nmap to maintain its style).\n... also, if each map has its own collection of element style defaults, then a\nnew map created within this map could inherit that set of defaults.\n\nto reiterate: I think the qualitative experience of using Compendium could be\nimproved hugely merely by improving the fluency of style management.\n\nComment 1 Al Selvin 2011-02-06 18:05:31 GMT\n\nJust a comment. \n\nYou can do many of these things already in Compendium by setting Project or\nUser Options (Tools menu), as well as by creating custom Link Groups, Stencils,\nand other means.\n\nHaving said that, it could always be easier to do.

Unfortunately, it''s not easy to create space on the Compendium background\nfor new windows.  Windows can''t have their boundaries moved beyond the\nbackground boundary.  That means there''s a lot of window management activity in\nresponse to something conceptually simple.\n\nAlso, because mysql projects can be accessed across different pcs (with\ndifferent screen dimensions) then this means a map that opened ok on one\nscreen, may be too large for another screen - despite not being designed for\nthis eventuality.  This means some fiddly window management required to "pull\nin" the map boundary from beyond the edge of the background boundary.\n\nfeature request:\n================\nA solution to this could be to allow window to be designed to be moved such\nthat their boundaries go beyond the background boundary.

I also use the Workspaces system to layout and remember\narrangements of maps I use a lot.The Window Menu also has the usual Cascade and\ntile options (which would recover Windows if they left the visible area). \n\nIn older versions of Compendium windows they could leave the visible area. But\nthen we had complaints about lost windows going off the edge and then I think I\nadded the constraint that the Windows had to stay. I started writting a scroll\nmechanism so Windows could go off, but you could scroll to them. I had issues\ngetting this working and it was buggy. So for a quick fix I just stopped\nWindows leaving the area. It is something I need to go back to.\n\nMichelle',0,'compendiumng')

In order to participate in the\ntimeline view, the node would probably need to be manually dated, as the\nmodification date of the node is probably not meaningful in this context.\n\nHere''s an example of how I envision this working. Suppose I''m investigating the\nhistorical development of an idea (for example, the concept of a "canon of\nscripture" in Judaism and Christianity). In the course of my research, I\naccumulate various quotations from relevant ancient and modern writers and I\nstuff them into Reference nodes, which I tag with dates indicating my best\nguess of what year each quotation was written. These quotations are probably\nsupporting facts in the argument structure of one or more of my map views, but\nI also want to see how they relate to one another chronologically, so I\ncopy/paste them into a timeline view. Then, to provide additional context, I\ncreate additional nodes directly in the timeline view representing the dates of\nvarious events (e.g., the Council of Trent) and the lifespans of the relevant\nfigures (e.g., the life of Eusebius). In this way, I construct a visual\nchronology of the topic I''m investigating, with each node in the timeline being\nhyperlinked to references, related events and/or argumentation related to that\nevent.\n\nOne issue to keep in mind is that dates of ancient events are generally\nimprecise, and sometimes disputed. Thus, the date that a particular event\nhappened (e.g., the composition of the document known as "the Gospel according\nto Mark") could be the subject of one of the Questions under argumentation,\nwith different authors proposing different dates and arguing for their\nproposals, and the user might make a Decision regarding this issue. In my\nopinion, the timeline view should be able to indicate (a) spans of time (e.g.,\nby drawing the event as a rectangle rather than as a single point in time) as\nwell as (b) uncertainty/debate regarding a date/span (e.g., by drawing the\nuncertain time span as a fade-out from fully opaque to fully transparent.\n\nThe timeline view might be even more useful if, instead of having to manually\ncopy/paste nodes into the timeline view, I can instead link the timeline view\nto one or more map/list views, so that anything in one of those views with an\nassociated date is automatically plotted on the timeline. This would make it\nharder for things to get out-of-sync between my various views, since I only\nneed to worry about dating the various nodes, and not also copy/pasting them.\nOne additional enhancement could make it _impossible_ for things to get\nout-of-sync: if I could set a constraint on my map/list view that says\n"everything in here is required to have a date", then Compendium could help me\nby complaining "hey, you need to give this node a date!". Or, alternately,\nnodes in the linked views that don''t have dates could be drawn in a "date\nunknown" region of the timeline, which would be a way of visually notifying me\nthat I''d forgotten to date something.',0,'compendiumng')

And then, the symbols surrounding the icons are arcane to the\nnew user, or worse, to the non-user.\n\nAnd this leads to an additional shortcoming - I want to use the mind-map to\n_communicate_ to another person.  I want them to be able to "see" my ideas, not\nsome arcane "structure" and classification system.

The "tree" should be modeled as "flat" and\nvisible, rather than "deep" and invisible.

Somewhere in the menus (probably "Tools")\nthere''s an item that opens up a "search manager" or some such, in which I can\nspecify URLs and query string formats for interacting with various sites on the\nInternet. You might consider using one or more of the existing web standards\nfor defining search engine interactions, such as OpenSearch and/or Sherlock,\nand let me download pre-defined search plugins from the web.\nhttp://mycroft.mozdev.org/ claims to have over 23,000 search plugins for\nvarious browsers...it would be nice if Compendium could download and use these\nrather than requiring me to describe the search protocol myself. (Bonus points\nif Compendium automatically checks for updates to the plugins every so often!)\n\nAnyway, however the search plugins get created, once I have them registered\nwith Compendium, I''d like to be able to create Reference nodes that use them\ninstead of requiring me to input a URL. I think this could be done in the UI by\nmigrating the current Reference-specific fields into their own "Reference" tab\nalongside "Contents", "Properties" and "Views". In this tab, the first UI\nelement would be a drop-down box that lets me choose "URL" (in order to get the\ncurrent Reference behavior) or any of my currently registered search plugins.\nThe rest of the UI in this tab would change based on the variable fields\nspecific to my selected search plugin. So, for example, if Bugzilla search lets\nme specify (a) keywords (b) bug status (c) bug ID and (d) opened-by, all of\nthese would be text fields or drop-downs (as appropriate), created based on the\ndefinition of the search plugin. (Bonus points if the search plugin''s icon is\ndisplayed as the Reference node icon.)\n\nAlso, I think that if you reworked the Reference UI in this way, you could also\nextend this to handle internal reference nodes more elegantly: if I select\n"Internal" from the reference type drop-down, the UI could change to some kind\nof graphical selector that allows me to choose a node from one of my maps,\nright from the dialog box. This would be instead of that very cryptic comp://\nURL that you currently allow me to edit (but warn me not to touch in the help\nfiles).\n\nProbably also related to 974.\n\nAlso, it would be super-cool if there were some really efficient way to create\nReference nodes using certain search engines. For example, if I have a search\nplugin that targets http://www.biblegateway.com, I''d like to be able to use a\nhot-key to insert a Reference using this plugin, and then just type the search\ntext as the node label (e.g., "John 3:16"), and have the primary search field\nauto-populated with this value, without me ever having to open up the contents\ndialog box.',0,'compendiumng')

Architecturally, we are unable to use either\nthe MySQL or Apache Derby databases and any database that we do use cannot be\ninstalled locally on a user machine.  Our development teams have looked at the\npossibility of modifying the code to support a SQL Server or Oracle DBMS and\nutilise a central database however their estimates of the effort involve\nindicate a significant cost to this.  I was wondering if any other companies\nmay have undertaken this work already and submitted it back to yourselves for\ndistribution or whether this is something the compendium team are working on\nfor a future release.\n\nMany thanks,\nTrevor Davies\nTechnical Architect\nBritish Energy\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 1 Michelle Bachler 2007-06-13 12:50:11 BST\n\nNo, unfortunately not and we have no plans at present to extend the system to\nsupport further databases. You can submit a feature request for this, and it\nwill be considered along with all others, but it is unlikely to become a\npriority for us at present. This is the sort of area that we hoped external\ndevelopers would contribute in though.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 2 Dirk Gorissen 2010-02-16 08:46:38 GMT\n\nIts been more than two years since this post but it is an issue I am also\ninterested in.  From the mailinglist I understood that still no work has been\ndone in this direction.\n\nI loaded the code into eclipse and it all looks quite clean and well\nstructured.  The SQL looks fairly standard as well so Im almost tempted to give\nit a shot.  The only problem is the distinction between Derby and MySQL is made\nusing constants and methods with different names, spread across different\nclasses.  Adding versions for SQLServer is probably not the cleanest way to go\nabout this.  \n\nAnyway, if I do produce some working code I will post it here.\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 3 Michelle Bachler 2010-02-16 11:56:34 GMT\n\nYes, sorry about that.\nAt some point I wanted to abstract it all more, so it was easier to add new\ndatabase types. But I have not had the time/requirement to do this extra work\non the code so far.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know.\n\nMichelle\n\n[reply] [-] Comment 4 Chris Davies 2010-10-21 15:34:47 BST\n\nIs it correct that this request is for Compendium to support multiple projects\nwithin a single database?

It''s certainly not an absent\nminded momentary triviality to create a consistent style (which deviates\nsignificantly from the default) within a map or between maps (for nodes, links,\nbackgrounds, text, etc.)\n\nI think the qualitative experience of using Compendium could be improved hugely\nmerely by improving the fluency of style management.\n\ni suggest using style palettes. \n\nBy "palette" i mean, for each compendium element that can have style: a list of\nstyles available for selection. \n* Each compendium element will have its own style list.\n* The style list will have a default where a new compendium elements is created\nwith the default style. The default can be changed.\n* The list can added to by selection of a compendium element and copying its\nstyle to the list, the new style being nameable. (eg. select compendium item,\nclick a menu strip button or rt click and "add to style list")\n* The list can have items renamed and deleted.\n\nI suppose the compendium elements are: node, link and map(open).  Maybe each\nnode type could have its own style palette.\n\neg. for a link style, i should be able to set all the qualities for a link\n(including text), and save it to a name in the link style palette.  I should\nalso be able to select one or a number of links and click a "style button" to\napply that style onto the element(s).\n\nsimilarly for nodes and maps.\n\n... just to go further out on the limb ...\nrather than have the style palette defaults be global, it might be useful to\nhave:\neach map have its own set of element style defaults (to make it easier for each\nmap to maintain its style).\n... also, if each map has its own collection of element style defaults, then a\nnew map created within this map could inherit that set of defaults.\n\nto reiterate: I think the qualitative experience of using Compendium could be\nimproved hugely merely by improving the fluency of style management.\n\nComment 1 Al Selvin 2011-02-06 18:05:31 GMT\n\nJust a comment. \n\nYou can do many of these things already in Compendium by setting Project or\nUser Options (Tools menu), as well as by creating custom Link Groups, Stencils,\nand other means.\n\nHaving said that, it could always be easier to do.

Unfortunately, it''s not easy to create space on the Compendium background\nfor new windows.  Windows can''t have their boundaries moved beyond the\nbackground boundary.  That means there''s a lot of window management activity in\nresponse to something conceptually simple.\n\nAlso, because mysql projects can be accessed across different pcs (with\ndifferent screen dimensions) then this means a map that opened ok on one\nscreen, may be too large for another screen - despite not being designed for\nthis eventuality.  This means some fiddly window management required to "pull\nin" the map boundary from beyond the edge of the background boundary.\n\nfeature request:\n================\nA solution to this could be to allow window to be designed to be moved such\nthat their boundaries go beyond the background boundary.  It would make moving\nwindows out of the way to find a previously covered and relevant map a simple\nact rather than a fiddly one.\n\nBut .. this could create an additional problem .. a map that has been moved\nnear to the edge of the background on one pc screen, could be beyond the edge\nand not at all visible on another pc with a smaller screen ..\n\nfeature request:\n================\n.. so, i suggest a window management menu option to "gather" all open maps to\nthe top left of the background. .. or .. \nfeature request:\n================\ncompendium, when opening a map, auto-detects its position relative to the\nbackground and moves it to top-left if it''s beyond the bounds of the\nbackground.\n\n-- i hope i haven''t explained myself in too confusing a manner.

I also use the Workspaces system to layout and remember\narrangements of maps I use a lot.The Window Menu also has the usual Cascade and\ntile options (which would recover Windows if they left the visible area). \n\nIn older versions of Compendium windows they could leave the visible area. But\nthen we had complaints about lost windows going off the edge and then I think I\nadded the constraint that the Windows had to stay. I started writting a scroll\nmechanism so Windows could go off, but you could scroll to them. I had issues\ngetting this working and it was buggy.

In order to participate in the\ntimeline view, the node would probably need to be manually dated, as the\nmodification date of the node is probably not meaningful in this context.\n\nHere''s an example of how I envision this working. Suppose I''m investigating the\nhistorical development of an idea (for example, the concept of a "canon of\nscripture" in Judaism and Christianity). In the course of my research, I\naccumulate various quotations from relevant ancient and modern writers and I\nstuff them into Reference nodes, which I tag with dates indicating my best\nguess of what year each quotation was written. These quotations are probably\nsupporting facts in the argument structure of one or more of my map views, but\nI also want to see how they relate to one another chronologically, so I\ncopy/paste them into a timeline view. Then, to provide additional context, I\ncreate additional nodes directly in the timeline view representing the dates of\nvarious events (e.g., the Council of Trent) and the lifespans of the relevant\nfigures (e.g., the life of Eusebius). In this way, I construct a visual\nchronology of the topic I''m investigating, with each node in the timeline being\nhyperlinked to references, related events and/or argumentation related to that\nevent.\n\nOne issue to keep in mind is that dates of ancient events are generally\nimprecise, and sometimes disputed. Thus, the date that a particular event\nhappened (e.g., the composition of the document known as "the Gospel according\nto Mark") could be the subject of one of the Questions under argumentation,\nwith different authors proposing different dates and arguing for their\nproposals, and the user might make a Decision regarding this issue. In my\nopinion, the timeline view should be able to indicate (a) spans of time (e.g.,\nby drawing the event as a rectangle rather than as a single point in time) as\nwell as (b) uncertainty/debate regarding a date/span (e.g., by drawing the\nuncertain time span as a fade-out from fully opaque to fully transparent.\n\nThe timeline view might be even more useful if, instead of having to manually\ncopy/paste nodes into the timeline view, I can instead link the timeline view\nto one or more map/list views, so that anything in one of those views with an\nassociated date is automatically plotted on the timeline. This would make it\nharder for things to get out-of-sync between my various views, since I only\nneed to worry about dating the various nodes, and not also copy/pasting them.\nOne additional enhancement could make it _impossible_ for things to get\nout-of-sync: if I could set a constraint on my map/list view that says\n"everything in here is required to have a date", then Compendium could help me\nby complaining "hey, you need to give this node a date!". Or, alternately,\nnodes in the linked views that don''t have dates could be drawn in a "date\nunknown" region of the timeline, which would be a way of visually notifying me\nthat I''d forgotten to date something.')

So we would need to add a new\nproperty to nodes in general. We have talked about it and how it might work,\nbut so far it has not made it onto the ''to do'' list.\n\nComment 2 Sunnysekot 2011-09-16 16:43:05 BST\n\nWell, adding another property for the nodes might be an overkill if it was\nneeded only in List View.\n\nBut for me the list is not much like a list like this. Maybe this list could be\nextended by a property which is added only for the list?\n\nI understand, that the listing feature is just listing something which is\nalready there inside your database, but what about some invisible dummy\nvariable which can be viewed and filled only inside list view?\n\nAnyhow, I´d really love to sort my list by my own criterion...\n\n')

Somewhere in the menus (probably "Tools")\nthere''s an item that opens up a "search manager" or some such, in which I can\nspecify URLs and query string formats for interacting with various sites on the\nInternet. You might consider using one or more of the existing web standards\nfor defining search engine interactions, such as OpenSearch and/or Sherlock,\nand let me download pre-defined search plugins from the web.\nhttp://mycroft.mozdev.org/ claims to have over 23,000 search plugins for\nvarious browsers...it would be nice if Compendium could download and use these\nrather than requiring me to describe the search protocol myself. (Bonus points\nif Compendium automatically checks for updates to the plugins every so often!)\n\nAnyway, however the search plugins get created, once I have them registered\nwith Compendium, I''d like to be able to create Reference nodes that use them\ninstead of requiring me to input a URL. I think this could be done in the UI by\nmigrating the current Reference-specific fields into their own "Reference" tab\nalongside "Contents", "Properties" and "Views". In this tab, the first UI\nelement would be a drop-down box that lets me choose "URL" (in order to get the\ncurrent Reference behavior) or any of my currently registered search plugins.\nThe rest of the UI in this tab would change based on the variable fields\nspecific to my selected search plugin. So, for example, if Bugzilla search lets\nme specify (a) keywords (b) bug status (c) bug ID and (d) opened-by, all of\nthese would be text fields or drop-downs (as appropriate), created based on the\ndefinition of the search plugin. (Bonus points if the search plugin''s icon is\ndisplayed as the Reference node icon.)\n\nAlso, I think that if you reworked the Reference UI in this way, you could also\nextend this to handle internal reference nodes more elegantly: if I select\n"Internal" from the reference type drop-down, the UI could change to some kind\nof graphical selector that allows me to choose a node from one of my maps,\nright from the dialog box. This would be instead of that very cryptic comp://\nURL that you currently allow me to edit (but warn me not to touch in the help\nfiles).\n\nProbably also related to 974.\n\nAlso, it would be super-cool if there were some really efficient way to create\nReference nodes using certain search engines. For example, if I have a search\nplugin that targets http://www.biblegateway.com, I''d like to be able to use a\nhot-key to insert a Reference using this plugin, and then just type the search\ntext as the node label (e.g., "John 3:16"), and have the primary search field\nauto-populated with this value, without me ever having to open up the contents\ndialog box.')
