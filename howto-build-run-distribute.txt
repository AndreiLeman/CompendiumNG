== how to build ==

In order to build Compendium you will need:

a) maven
b) internet connection
c) java jdk 1.6


to do it go first fetch the sources code of Compendium either as a tarball or
directly from the source code repository which is: ......


change to the directory with compendium and run: "mvn clean package"

after this this "talkative" command finishes you should find the prepared jar
file (with all depenedencies packed in) in the target directory.

== how to install ==

You can also decide to get rid of source code and keep just what you need to
run Compendium. In that case you choose directory (i.e. Compendium) 
and then copy:
	target/Compendium_jar_file.jar
	Compendium.sh
	Compendium.bat
	System
	... 
	TODO: complete the list

	into your selected directory

After then you should be able to run Compendium with a script which is
suitable for your platform (Compendium.bat for windows, Compendium.sh for
linux....)

after that you can delete the directory where you compiled the souce code
