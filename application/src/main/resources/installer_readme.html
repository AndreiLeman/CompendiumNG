<h3>CompendiumNG</h3>
... is a powerful application that lets you create 
extensive maps using nodes and link structure. Common usages 
of Compendium include dialogue mapping and mind mapping but its uses are 
almost limitless. Compendium was originally developed as 
a project by the OpenUniversity. In 2009 it was released
as open source under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL) 
and in 2012 the Compendium community established CompendiumNG
as an effort to maintain and further develop this great software.
